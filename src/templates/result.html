            The model rates your essay on a scale from 0 to 4. Lower ratings suggest lower quality writing whereas higher scores
            demonstrate the opposite. To understand your score better, you can take a look at the table below.

        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>
            The process of grading an essay can be divided into two major phases. In the first phase, the essay is 
            thoroughly analyzed for all kinds of grammatical features. These can range from basic statistical 
            features such as word count to more complex ones like sentiment. Once these features have been 
            extracted, the model then attempts to make a prediction using these features.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the model itself, it has been trained on 12,976 essays spread over 8 different sets and 
            uses the Random Forest Classifier for generating predictions.

        <h4>Essay Analysis Report</h4>
        <p>
            An analysis report of all the features extracted and analyzed from your essay.
            Note that essays are analyzed <b>after</b> all stopwords have been removed.
            This is the reason why some values may seem "incorrect".
