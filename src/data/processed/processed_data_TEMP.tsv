0	1	7	Cho is a passionate comic lover. Every week Cho would meet up with his friends and read the newly released weekly comic. They  would endlessly talk about the new chapter that was released. The only problem with the comic that Cho disliked was, it uploaded only once a week, not only that it would go on short random hiatuses. It was a new week. The Weekly comic has released its weekly chapter. Cho and his friends gathered at the nearby park and read the comic together. After reading the comic they all had a group discussion about what the chapter was about and tried to guess what the next chapter will be about. They were sad that the chapter ended in a cliff hanger. But that didn't bother them. They laughed and talked and returned home shortly after. Night approached. Cho now at home, was lying on his bed and staring at the ceiling. He couldn't stop thinking about the cliff hanger, or what was going to happen next. Cho felt impatient and angsty, he could not sit still and spent money for the next chapter. He read it and laughed by himself. As he came to the chapter's end, he felt a bit lonely. He always read the comics with his friends and shared what he felt about the chapter. To fill this empty void and to get that short happiness, Cho cashed in and bought the next chapter. As Cho read the story, it came to a cliffhanger. Cho yet again angsty and restless he buys the next chapter. Cho couldn't stop being impatient and gave himself excuses to make him feel good about himself. Cho binged through the entire comic that night. The next week when Cho and his friends met up. They read the new chapter together and spoke their mind out. Cho felt happy and enjoyed the moment. He re-read the chapter but did not feel the same excitement he had last night when he read the fresh new chapter. He spoke with his friends about the new chapter but didn't feel the same excitement as last week when they were all together discussing the chapter they newly read. Cho wouldn't feel the same excitement he had when he first read it by himself, he wouldn't feel the same excitement when they read it together and tried to guess what awaits in the new chapter, he wouldn't feel the same excitement when he guesses correctly. Cho has gone so far ahead that it will his friends another 34 weeks to catch up to where he has read. Only if Cho was patient he could have had the same excitement, happiness, eagerness when reading with friends. To feel that same feeling he will need to wait another 34 weeks. And maybe before the time comes he would probably would have gotten tired of waiting and either left the comic or spend more on the comic	0	73	0	86	0	20	28	46	35	28	16	26	184	1.8918918918918919	19	6.599518627997769	210	33	111	Cho passionate comic lover week Cho meet friends read newly released weekly comic   endlessly talk new chapter released problem comic Cho disliked uploaded week short random hiatuses new week Weekly comic released weekly chapter Cho friends gathered nearby park read comic reading comic group discussion chapter tried guess chapter sad chapter ended cliff hanger bother laughed talked returned home shortly Night approached Cho home lying bed staring ceiling stop thinking cliff hanger going happen Cho felt impatient angsty sit spent money chapter read laughed came chapter end felt bit lonely read comics friends shared felt chapter fill void short happiness Cho cashed bought chapter Cho read story came cliffhanger Cho angsty restless buys chapter Cho stop impatient gave excuses feel good Cho binged entire comic night week Cho friends met read new chapter spoke mind Cho felt happy enjoyed moment read chapter feel excitement night read fresh new chapter spoke friends new chapter feel excitement week discussing chapter newly read Cho feel excitement read feel excitement read tried guess awaits new chapter feel excitement guesses correctly Cho gone far ahead friends 34 weeks catch read Cho patient excitement happiness eagerness reading friends feel feeling need wait 34 weeks maybe time comes probably gotten tired waiting left comic spend comic	0.1081890331890332	0.438143338143338	0.185	0.049	0.767	0.9978	"Write about patience.
