10687	17838	7	I going to write about a time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair, we had fun, we saw a ride we wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said. @CAPS1 get on another ride then. We already tried the other rides, my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didnt desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think theyre holding you up, but its the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, dont shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just dont think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then youll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride.	8	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10688	17839	7	It can be very hard for somebody to be patient. If you are patient, then you are understanding and tolerant. You have to be patient sometimes. When you go to the dentist or doctors office, you need to be very patient. There was a girl who had to go to the dentist. She hated the dentist. It was always so boring. First, youd sit there while your parents did a whole bunch of paperwork. You have to just sit there for like @NUM1 minutes before you even go in. Then, when you finally go in, they start working on your teeth for like ten minutes, then youd sit there for another fifteen minutes. Finally, When you are done getting your teeth cleaned youd sit there for another ten minutes while your parents talk to the dentist. So, you need to be patient sometimes, even when you are just dying of boredome.	7	6		2				1.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	2.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hipper non patience horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a chestnut quarter horse with a white star on his forehead who is very un patient. He is always hipper and ready to go. For example when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride in our back trains he dose not stand still when I am tacking him up at the post. And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And thats when he gets unpatient. No matter what he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around and walk back to the group. Meany times I have tried training him to be patient but I have always failed. I guess he just always has to be doing something. But I will always love him no matter how un patience he is.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

I was super hot day, I was at @CAPS1 point with my best friend and we were geting ready to get on the dragster. The line is about an hour long and the sun is beating down on you so to me it felt like forever. Just as we were about to go on the ride they steped us because the ride wasent working right. So we had to wait another @NUM1 mins. Luckly my best firend and I had good patients unlike some of the other people who stormed out of there in the first five minutes. We waited and got on the ride and it was one of the most fun experences of my life. Im so happy we waited said @PERSON1 my best firend. Some people have patient like  @PERSON1 and I, and some dont like the the people who ran of there. Im glade we waited or that would not have happened. In this case patient was a great thing for @PERSON1 and I.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 ½ hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ½  hour drive.

10707	17860	7	Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have savere anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family!!! They had grandkids that really annoyed me!!! My foster family had a different religion than me I am atheist. They are @CAPS1 and they would constantly tell me I am wrong!!! It made me very upset but I didnt say nothing because I was being patient. And I hate it. With my anger problems im very surprised I didnt go off on them? But yes patience does take practice lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient!!! Tolerance twords children I dont like kids to much but where I wed to live there were tons of little kids that were the grand kids of my foster family and I sued those kids are annoying but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate and so are guardian parents they are the worst they tell you what to do and they aint even youre parents but I tolerated it.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10708	17861	7	One when I was patient was when we were going of north. We had to pack but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing else to do when I went back inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were finished packing. When we got going I had to wait for over @NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to mackinoc city from nbly. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10709	17862	7	Patients is verey important. But I m not verey good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I going to say. I guess I m not verey patient because my family is not verey patient. My family is not verey patient because we just want to say what were gona say before we forget it. Are family it also verey forgetful. That is probably another reason why we arnt patient. Patients is im portant because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait turn.

10714	17868	7	Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been their most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 new why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesnt know why she didnt see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream @CAPS3! @CAPS3! but it didnt work he would just keep going and acting like he didnt hear her. @PERSON1 isnt fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesnt like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they dont know if theyll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and Ive asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad.	8	7		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10717	17871	7	One in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young named  @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2 honor was everythbing, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer-like animal.  As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready,@CAPS4 of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. @CAPS5 did you not take the shot? whispered @PERSON1. @CAPS6 was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 wiithout pain. @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The danes rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. @CAPS5 did you not take the shot? whispered @PERSON1. @CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6s back turned. @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. @CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased. @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10719	17873	7	A long time ago me and my family were going to a cottage we owned. It was about a four hour drive. It is the funniest place to go to. I was so happy I couldnt wait until we got there. I new I had to be patient. But I wanted to get there so bad. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble. I know that because I had to learn the way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking to long. Then when we got home later on that hight I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking to long. So on our way to my grandmas cottage I didnt complain. Not complaining is smart to do. If you are unpatient dont go on long trips. Its good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandmas my mom was happy with me. If you are patient people will know that you are a very tolerant person.	9	7		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10722	17876	7	One @DATE1 week a couple of years ago my grandparents were over. We went to my @ORGANIZATION1s sisters house and my @ORGANIZATION1 and aunt (my @ORGANIZATION1s sister) were going to teach me hoe to tie my shoes because I was going into kindergarten and the teacher wouldnt do it for you. They said if I learned to tie my shoes I would get to pick something out at the dollar store so that got me all excited! When we got their after I had lunch they began teaching me. The tirck they taught me went like this: after you have the first crossover step you make the bop(tree) and you put the other string around it (the bunny loving around the tree. @CAPS1 you put it through (the bunny darling in its hole.) @CAPS1 youre bond. After many tries was starting to get the hang of it. Later we went back to my house and my @ORGANIZATION1 kept helping me. Finally one afternoon I got it, my @ORGANIZATION1 was happy and she kept telling me good job. Later we went to the store and picked something out! My @ORGANIZATION1 had to be patient with me. She wasnt getting all mad when I kept messing up she just kept being encouraging and patient. My @ORGANIZATION1 was patient and it helped me learn faster.	8	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10723	17878	7	Patience. Being patient means that you needs to make and dor one' thing constantly to make one????understand. That is patience. My mom is patient. When I dart understand a problem, she will explain @CAPS1 to me, never in rush. She don't yell a t me when I don't understand, unlike my dad, who is very impatient. He would yell, and possiblely cursed at me in chinease. That happens nearly every time I don't understand something. But my mom will contune explain to me until I understand what @CAPS1 means. Some people @MONTH1 be impatient because of triats or because that he or she has high blood pressure.

10725	17880	7	Swimming is a lot of fun. I enjoy feeling the cool water all around me. Patience is an important part of the swimming you have to be patient when waiting to start practice, stretching, waiting for instruction when learning a new stroke learning a new way to turn at the wall, ect. On the first day of swim team this year the coaches went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who knew this stuff already, like me it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a good job listening. Patience is important.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10726	17881	7	Patience what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it we could all be patient. One time when I was in @LOCATION1 we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and we rod no wait for any of the rides. The next time we went there we had to be patient because the lines were really long. I could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still. Another example about patences is when the miners got stated in the mine in @LOCATION2 for @NUM1 days they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when the were coming up from the mine in that little elevator thingy magig. One last example on patence is when you are walking in a group with other people you have to be patient and listen to there ideas and let them do some of the work. These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient.	6	6		2				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10732	17887	7	It was my first camping trip! Well, we went camping when I was one but I dont remenber a lot. I was super excited! So, Im sorry if I couldnt help but wonder @CAPS1 the ? are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or,when are we leaving? Everytime I got, just be patient hunny. So, I tried it wasnt really working.We finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said daddy when are we gonna be there? I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsut  on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pots. I was going to go knock of the bathroom door but, I didnt I took what I had learnt earier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today. But every one in a while everyone is a little impatient.	10	10		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10733	17888	7	A time of when I was patient was when me & my siblings were waiting to see if they were going to alow us to get our first puppy. We waited & waited for about an hour while my parent were discussing if we should or shouldnt. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dads decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldnt resist. So he then said yes. I then had to be patient. We were going out of town in two days so we couldnt get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bring the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went & got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. He was surprised and over joyed to see us playing with @CAPS1 outside. we all fell love with @CAPS1 & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy!	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

My two sister and I boreded @CAPS1 to florda. It seemed like we were sitting on the @CAPS1 for hours befor it actually took off. After about ten minutes, I asked if we would be there soon. My sister said no, and that we were only up in the air for about ten minutes. I watched all at the people just sitting there some were on laptops and listening to @CAPS2 players. I looked up at my sister and wondered how she could be so patient. After I asked if we were almost there for the second time, my sister did not answer me. I just sat there doing nothing. I had nothing to entertain myself with. I did not say a word for two hours then I eventually fell asleep. If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation?

10743	17899	7	@CAPS1! Look out! @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Heres a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. Its unbearable to watch. Ambulences sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And thats @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, Id lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadnt made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, Id still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe its just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldnt know because in no way we we typical. When we arent fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. @CAPS4, @CAPS5 starts, I know I havent been patient with you lately, and for that Im sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing. I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself? @CAPS5 didnt have to explain any farther. @CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around, my voice caught in my throat, just to get my stupid notebook. A single tear weaved its way down my face. @CAPS7, hunny! my mother teared up as @CAPS6. That doesnt make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way! I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. @CAPS8, I said, regaining composure, thats how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8. @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mothers lips. I will wait then. And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10751	17908	7	One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you  are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one.I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree.I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didnt blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldnt have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10752	17909	7	I was patient a few years ago with my brother @PERSON1. It was almost his birthday, and he was very excited. He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television, the helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birth day or not .He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it so he kept bugging me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying .I did not, because I knew if I did I would get in trouble. So I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didnt work, because he kept on asking me any way. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over. Finally he stopped asking me about the helicopter and after we ate cake, we actually had to remind him about it. When he opened his presents, he did get a helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to make it fly.	10	11		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

When I was little I always thought it would be simply impossible to have a thing like that, but after I badly hurt my ankle and was pat in a cast and on crutches for four months, I really got the hang of it. My mom would always say patience is vertue, have you ever wondered what it takes to have patience?

My little brother came running over their and I told him to go and get help. He had no idea where to go so I lied on the ground with a broken foot for over @NUM1. when my brother returned he asked where do I go? And I told him to go to the gas station across the street and ask to use the telephone I was trying to be patient when  he got back he had my mom. My mom said that I was really patient. She picked me up and we drove to the emergency room. When we got there it was packed. They got us in as soon as they could but it felt like along time to me. When he called my name my mom picked me up and she went toward the doctor. He asked what brings you here? we told him the news and he took into the room. The doctor moved my foot around. Ten minutes later he came back in with the x-rays and annoced to us that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crushes and then we left. I told my brother thank you and gave him really big hug. The next day everyone at school said that I was brave and very patient and I said thank you!	12	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10766	17923	7	Some people say that if somebodys trying to annoy you and you are patient then they will stop, but thats not always true. One day my brother was down loading new ringtones, which I thought was no big dig deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone.  The mosquito tone is a loud highpitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. Its really funny if you the one playing it but if your listening to it. it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother has this idea. the one only a jerk could have. he decides hes going to follow me around playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible, it made my blood curtle. After thirty minutes I decided to call my but it didnt really help. Then I listened to music, so he turned it up. Then I had this amazing idea. I stole his battery. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that ringtone I would give him back his battery. Of cource he said yes so I didnt have to the tone anymore. So now you know why patience doesnt always work.	12	9		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10768	17926	7	Patience is hard for me because I have almost no patients for anything! So you can imagine how hard it was for me and anyone else who has no patience waiting in lines at disneyland. First of all the drive- it was horrible and long. We were in the car for what seemed like forever before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient and I wa s. I didnt complain at all. When we got to disneyland the firs day the lines were terrible! Some of the waits were up t @NUM1 hours long! Well i didnt complain,but it was hard not to!My little brother wanted to go on all these kid rides that the lines were huge for , but i held my patients not wanting to get anyone upset. Since I like everything to get done fast and not waste my time waiting i felt like i was going to explode at dinner. Dinner was a this seafood resteraunt wich was bad anyway because i hate seafood!while all this waiting was happening I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the disney busses to get back to your hotel. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patients through all of the waiting. I learned all lot of things there. One disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient. Second patients is one of the hardest things in life, but some of the best things in life require you to have patience. So,thats @NUM2 time I had to have a lot of patients, but i realized patients is a good thing to have.	10	11		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

While I was in the line there was this girl who had no patient cause we had to wait in line for @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours when that time past we all went to get our spots and before we had did that there was this long line again but even longer but it was ok cause I had patients.

10771	17930	7	I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didnt keep my mouth shut so my mom didnt want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. Thats exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot patience to get my reward.	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

If you wait and practice more, it will be easier,"" said @PERSON1, as she spotted one of the other gymnasts in their back-hard-spring. We had been working on our back-hard-springs for weeks and I was the best at them, in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started  on our back flips, but I really wanted to try it out. I rolled my eyes at @ORGANIZATION1's answer, and continued to practice my back-hard-springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called @PERSON1 so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and @PERSON1 was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. ""@CAPS2!"" I yelled. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so bad! @PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell, after attempting to stand up. ""@CAPS3 happened?"" ""I tried my back flip.""  ""I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!""  ""@CAPS4â¦"" ""I'll go get an ice pack."" @CAPS5 since that day, I have had problems with my ankle.

10778	17938	7	Patience is important in life. Something when you dont have patience things tend to go wrong and thats not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you dont have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldnt talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didnt have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didnt you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didnt have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didnt work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didnt get the shoes. Those were some people who didnt have patience. But if they did that wouldnt of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not.	5	4		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

I tried my best to clear my head and be paitient. But when I opened them, I was sitting on some bars in line for celar paints @ORGANIZATION1. The voices of many people ran through my ears as laughter, happiness, and danger. The line was estimates at a two hour wait, but my friend @PERSON1 and I wanted to ride the ride. We started up at the roller coaster while the sun beat down taunting us. @CAPS1 is this taking so long?! I said impatiently. @CAPS2 next time we should go during the week. Do you want to leave? @CAPS3.  I fought with myself to be patient for the ride. The line slowly scooted forth. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead. I wanted to remain patient, so I pulled out my music player and thought of my music. I became more willing to wait. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to move forward. Embarrassed, I jammed my music player in my pocket. But the line moved a tremendous amount. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were in the place to get on. I was proud of being patient. We looked at the ride and hopped on. Patience really pays off.

Very hard when your waiting in a line that is very loud or when you order something on the internet and you have to wait only two or three days. If your not a patient person that cant wait for the simplest thing that will only take a while then your a very impatient person that cant wait.

When you are sitting in a tree blind you @MONTH1 experience one of the most boreing @NUM1 minutes of your life, which definetly requires a lot of patience. After you settle in and are being quite the wood come alive all around you. I have to admit, I dont have a lot of patience, but hunting requires a different kind of patience. Hunting is something that many might think as just sitting around doing nothing. But if you are patient enough and quite you are rewarded with whatever you are hunting. This is one thing that I definetly think requires a lot of patience, but it is not the kind of patience that you would think of its an entertaining patience. That is why I think everyone should be more patient.	7	7		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10801	17965	7	In your own way about patience. How do you show patience you dont be rude and you just stand there and wait until your turn. To me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments. For example one time my mom friend was patience for her because she had to wait for her as my mom exchange my brother helment. When I was in the store my cousin was patience out an outfit and I was taking a long time. When my brother and I was in the shore he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patience. I didnt get mad or made rude comments. One time me and my nephew was in the store, and I was ordering some food and he made rude comments but he was impatience. Thy choice of patience is you have to be patience and wait your turn to go.  The whole purpose of this writing is you have to be patience in life.	6	6		2				1.0	2.0	1.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10810	17975	7	About three years ago, my family and I spent a weekend at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 sun dusky, @LOCATION1. It was a perfect weekend except driving four hours in car with older & younger siblings in the car. It was lould, there was crying, there was all of that annoying junk, but I was patient. When my family & I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it was crowded! Like jam pack crowded. My mom took little sister & brother on the kiddy rides & my dad took my brother and I. My group went on all of the big scary rides. I went on about every single scary ride that day except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This ride was the biggest one of all time. I was dying to go on it. My group got in line & relize their line was about half a mile long & there park was going to clothes soon. Twenty minutes later I was being so patient in this line. We were in the quarter of a mile range in the line. My dad decided it wasnt worth it. So my group met up with the rest of my family & we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the most sadest ride  move ever. So maybe next time I should be more patient.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10811	17976	7	Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isnt just waiting a long time, its being respectfull and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectfull and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If your at school and need to go to the bathroom wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when their talking. People will like you a little more if your patient. So remember, when your waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience.	5	4		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

Me and my sister @PERSON1 were playing aganist each other in @LOCATION2 for about an hour but as @CAPS4 played all i thought about was the camp. Later I was looking at a magazine about camping I didnt know it was about camping at first so that made me more exicited. Then i drew pictures for about an half an hour, that was fun.I ended up takeing up a nap for another half hour.  When I woke up I just starred at the road wide eyed constantly thinking about camp. Finally @CAPS2 said @CAPS4 are here kids! @CAPS3! @CAPS4 all @CAPS5. @CAPS4 set up camp, played on the play ground,went swimming,and had a bonfire. All that waiting was worth it.

10816	17981	7	Hi, im writing about the topic patience. I think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience everyone would be running crazy like banshees and getting mad al the time. It is important to have patients  because In life its not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient. Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people that arent patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience. That is what this world need, a little more patience. THE @CAPS2.	6	5		1				0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

It was @DATE1, exactly two mounts before my birthday. I went to my mom and asked her if I could get a phone. She said I was to young, and that she didn't get a phone till she was in college. I told her that everyone else had a cell phone but me, this was partly true. She told me she would about it, and that if I bugged her about it again she wouldn't get me a phone. It was @DATE3 now, just @NUM1 more days till my birthday. I thought about what kind of phone I wanted, I thought about what color case I would get for it. I thought about that phone for weeks. Then the day came, it was @DATE2, my birthday. I woke up in the morning to the smell of pancakes. After we ate we went to my grandma's house, because it was also thanksgiving. After dinner we went back to my house for my birthday supprise. I opened my pressants from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and then the last box. I opend it, it was my phone. I was so excited, I called all my friends on my new phone. That was the best birthday ever. It is a good thing to be patient, because I was patient I got the phone I wanted.

My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did!

10830	17997	7	This is the time when I was patient to my friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and me live in the same apartment building, so we hang out all the time. One day I had an @CAPS1 to go to the carnival. I noticed she wasnt liking the @CAPS1 than she said she was scared of rollercoasters, but I told her it wont be a big deal, we will not go on big rides. The day of the carnival, came I was exsited so was @PERSON1, as we got there she was really scared to go on the on therides,so I told her we could go on the smallest ride. After we went oh a few she wasnt scared as much. Than wall, we were walking she saw a ride, one of the bigest rides there, she said we should go on that so than I told her if she wonted to I we could go on it, and she was sure, after that ride we kept going on differnt bigger rides, wall we were walking she said thanks for having patience and that I was a good friend. In summary that was the time I had patience for a friend.	6	10		2				2.0	2.0	1.0	1.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10831	17998	7	There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10832	18000	7	The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved foward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally the piolt got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane and go back to the @LOCATION2. At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3 and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane. As we started moving forward the planes wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendents helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I a reed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3.	10	12		3				2.0	2.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10837	18006	7	When I was ten years old my mom promised me a phone. But then she I had to wait until @CAPS1. That got me mad because @CAPS1 wasn't until next month. I couldn't wait because this phone was a touchsreen with a key board. But I tried to be as patient as I could. The next day I kept seeing these commercials of the phone I wanted. It was very hard to be patient but I tried my best. So everyday I had to try to keep my mind on something besides the phone. Also a couple of my other friends had a phone and I really wanted to text them. Before I knew it it was only a week until @CAPS1 so I was excited, even though I had to pay for phone bill. I just wished the time would fly, but it didn't. So all I decided to do was wait. After six day past, tomorrow was already @CAPS1! My days of miserable waiting paid off! So I woke up the next day and opened my present and it was a brand new phone! My heart started beating of excitement. I was so happy then I thanked my mom. So being patient will eventually pay off.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10842	18014	7	Patience is a virtue I have always wanted. Sometimes I lose my patience when something take too long. In @ORGANIZATION1 seriously  there was an event called @CAPS1. It was raising and many people wanted to see if @CAPS2 would close down. The rain inocaculously did stop but I had to wait until @TIME1. It was only six for! So in other words my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was a unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with queued squeaky noises. My brother had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally they let us in at @TIME2, and we got pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, Im glad I was patient enough. The show was worth the wait.	12	8		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10845	18017	7	Being patient is sometimes hard but sometimes you dont care. There are many times I was patient. Sometimes I have to wait an hour or @NUM1 minutes. There is a time when I had to wait an hour. The one time when I was patient was at dance. My mom danced me off at @NUM2. I waited five minutes because I was a little yearly. After I waited five minutes I had worried that maybe they were in a different class but no they werent. After waiting thirdy minutes I was really bored and remembered that dance started at @TIME1. I could of called home but I didnt have my phone. Then when five more minutes went by I went in the playset. Me and myself swinging alone. When I was @TIME1 my mom came to pick me up from dance but I told her, it starts at @TIME1. So I have to leave. She kept asking me why I didnt call and I kept telling her I didnt have my phone. Then she left and I went to dance for two hours. Being patient that long is humble to me. I can go fifteen minutes but I cant go an hour. Thats one of the horrible times I was patient.	8	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10850	18022	7	Has your parents or you ever sent an application for a job? Well my uncle did and was very patient about it. He wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream. One day my uncle typed up an application for the job he wanted. When he was done he copied and paste it for an email. When he pressed send he hurried and grabbed his phone hoping for the job. He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call @CAPS2 still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place @CAPS2 he didnt. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. I was just my mom asking if he got the job @CAPS2 all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, @CAPS1 do you want! @CAPS2 not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great. So now knowing always be patient no matter @CAPS1 the deal is. My uncle @MONTH1 not be an expert @CAPS2 he should be now. Again remember to always be patient and good things will come your way.	8	10		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10853	18026	7	A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me now to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didnt always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words practice makes perfect she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. And that is an example of one time someone was patient with me.	8	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10856	18030	7	I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when her baby, @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it.	10	11		3				3.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10860	18034	7	Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friends house on a trapoline one hot @DATE1 day. When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to doctor. The doctor's office was exstremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctors office. Some times being patient has rewards.  My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

To and started talking to me about his family (just remember I wasnt very patient at the time.) @CAPS1 he kept going on and on until I snaped and said do you know to shut up! badly he said yes @CAPS1 ran home., crying. @CAPS1 I went home and when I got home I felt sad for the guy, @CAPS1 said sorry.! And for some reason he said got you I said what I was so mad but I was happy when it was over.

10871	18045	7	Here is a story, about patience, in my own way called @CAPS1s @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  @CAPS4, hurry up and find my shoes ??????  And I do not want to be late for school again. I hollered at my @CAPS4 @CAPS1, @CAPS4 said in a hustled voice, you asked me a second ago, it doesnt take a second to find some lost shoes, you just have to be patient. I know, I know, I sighed but I still dont want to be late I know but remember, being patient will get you far. @CAPS6 I agreed. So that @CAPS3 at school @CAPS1 remembered her moms words and was very patient all @CAPS3. She didnt whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, she didnt cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, she didnt grab the volleyball when someone had it the their shoe so she wouldnt be boared instead she stood there. During the end of the @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1 next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they  left the classroom. Prity soon every one started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that @CAPS3 I huged my @CAPS4 so hard then I told her what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from then on.	11	8		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

My classmates and I were divided into groups at differents areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification identifying the differen characteristics. So everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects be taping their plants on their poster. After fighting for the tape from another group hogging it. Our group finally had the tape. So our group was just done, and two people from another group came to get tape. One of them tried to take some pieces and I guess to the other one he was taking too long. So the one waiting says, @CAPS1 @CAPS2! as a sign of impatience. It was hilarious!	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10892	18068	7	Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? Im going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctors office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, thats why. The morning probably wasnt really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctors office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said I have an appointment for my son. And the lady at the front window said the @NUM1 appointment? @CAPS1 thats the one said my dad . Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me you know what? Youre a patient patient! I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasnt so patient , it mightve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I was to at the time I had my tweety @CAPS1 fishing in one hand and a bag of salt and viniger in the other. And while I was waiting for a fish, I met my friend bubbles a norweigian goose he was also out maybe a week old. When I met him I fed him some of my bait and I guessed he liked warms so I gave him all my bait put down pole. And as soon as I grabed my chips I had a bite! I turned out to be a very small sun fish. But still to this day I see bubble once a year (he lives near my favorite fishing spot). And this year he had some side kicks two ducks I named them @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. There are very friendly and love skittles. @CAPS2 is kind of shy around other ducks and @PERSON1 is very content just sitting next to me or a bench. And bubbles loves cheeses and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm @DATE1 grass. And this story is true.

When her mom asked her did the report cards come out. She said yeah then her mom found out its not a real report card. So her mom called the teachers and  it was a fake grade. Then she got introuble and she was patient about it and she said the truth. Her mom went to the  office and got the real grades and my friend @PERSON1 was patient while she said the truth. Thats a time were my friend @PERSON1 was patient about her grades. Even though she lied and tried to change her grade.She still was honest, and patient about it.

10901	18078	7	Have you ever been patient?  I have and I have to say it was rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room at the @ORGANIZATION1s @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  I planned to got my @CAPS1 washed, deep-condioned, and flat-ironed. The lady at the front desk called me up. Im sorry but @PERSON1 wont be here today.  @CAPS3 there anyone else that youd like to do your @CAPS1? A perplexed expression spread across my face. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 here? I asked. yes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three oclock. she suggested. thats fine.  I said.  My feelings  were  kind of  upset, but that  all  changed  when I  walked outside.  It was raining. So I guess it was a good thing that I didnt get my @CAPS1 done. It was a good thing that I was patient. Being patient has its advantages.	11	8		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10917	18095	7	I remember a time when I was patient. I use to be able to wait for anything.one time I was so patient I asked my mom for a game and she said, tomorrow and she got the game the day I asked her. At one time I thought I was the most patient person In my whole family. I am so patient I can wait a month just before I go to cedar point. You have to be burn with patient. Some of my friends are patient but they cant wait as long as I can. Some of them even ask me to teach them how to be patient. I say the same thing to them what I say to everybody who asked me about being patient. You have to be born with patient. Its not something you learn over the years. I could want three week without getting paid from my dad. As some people get older there grow lesser. That doesnt work on everybody. But sometime soon I know my patient will be like everyone else when I get older. Who knows maybe somebody might be more patient than me I the world.	6	9		2				0.0	1.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1 and we got out there at six-o-clock am and the waited there until nine oclock at night. The dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didnt even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that nigh we went home really hungry.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10927	18107	7	One thing I am not very at ient with is the meap. The reason I am not patient with the meap because it is very boring you can not talk and it is dull. I hate the meap it is very difficult, you dont see tenn see or @CAPS1 doing the meap. The meap expect you to do to much work the meap is one of the reason I dislike michgan. The meap asking you questions and words you never saw or herd before. In my opinion @CAPS2 we are going to do meap I wou ld prefer them to ask question and words that we know. Another thing I dont like about it is that they grade our writing on opinion they grade of what they think of it. To mi the meap is stupid @CAPS2 I had a choice I would chose not to do it. Since the meap is important I do it for my grade. These are the reason why I am very inpatient with the meap.	8	5		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10930	18110	7	A time when I was patient was @NUM1 for @CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a @ORGANIZATION1 fo @CAPS1 I was so happy then when @CAPS1 come and I was opening my presents there was no @ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it she said she would get it @DATE1 when taxes came so I had to be patient and wait for @NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @DATE1 came. It seemed like the days got longer and longer. I was getting mader and mader that was the longest @NUM2 months ever I didnt even know it could feel so long like that I though a year went by. Ater @DATE2 went by it was finally @DATE1 but I didnt get it to like the end of the month that just crushed my little heart so bodly to wait for some thing that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it was so fuh to play with all the games and apps and the conqurors is it was amazing.If something was to happen to it I would be destroyed. A @ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it you have to take care of it. Thats why is keeping in a special place away from little kids. I dont even let them play with it at all and if I feel hide they might can play with my supervision thats the only time they can play. That thing cost to much money to get lost or broken. Specially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting some thing like it but its some kind educational one. My little brother is getting, a ds..Im happy they getting some thing they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games to it for my birthday I had one but my little brother or sister lost it I was so angry how they cant play it at all. That was defenitly some thing to wait and be patient about. Thats why??? can play it because Im saved of il getting lost or broke. If it does my mom wont get another one.	8	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

I couldnt think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time.

10937	18119	7	The time that I was patient was today when everyone was takeing the @CAPS1.E.A.P. when we all get into the classroom nobody what so ever did not want to take the @CAPS1.E.A.P, when our teacher told us that we had to write on five pages and on @DATE1 we had to finish part two of the writing session, nobody wanted to. So when we got the  paket that we had to bubble in our answers we had to fill something out on the front of the paket. Then we had to put our first and last name on it befour we could take a break. When the break was over we needed to get a n free reading book and our teacher had to read all of us the directions to us we ,got started and when everyone was finished she told like five or more people that they could have a bathroom break, when everyone went she read the directions to the other part and when everyone was doing that same people got done really early and they got really board and they didnt want to read so then they all started to talk she would be right back that she had to go to the bathroom so once someone to came in and would wach us then all of the guys would make paper basket balls and started to shot them into into the tiny basket ball hoope and then she came in and told us to get in our seats and that we  would be starting the last writing sesson and that after this it would be lunch and it might even go though or lunch and then everyone was  freaking out.

I get really bad headaches. In school for example and Im waiting I get rigily like I tap my foot at tap my pencil and my desk. Tap ???everything things like that. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctors office, or flying on a plane for a while can get real boring. When I wait to long I feel lazy and tired because Im not moving at all. I get buggy when Im paitent, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than @NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I cant be paitent very long or I get buggy.

10943	18127	7	When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasnt in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didnt put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didnt know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasnt patient in this game we wouldnt have won and I wouldnt have gotten the trophy to take home with me.	8	10		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10950	18134	7	Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you dont complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they dont get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you shouldnt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you dont have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.	7	5		2				1.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10951	18135	7	Patient, thats all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back.

10955	18140	7	Two years ago, when the first @CAPS1 came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy all he did was brag to his family and friends about it. During this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his hone. So she was phoneless for aleast three months. She was kind a mad but it was worth being patient for. As the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it. She was so glad, she had more apps then the first @CAPS1 and a webcom. I think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldnt be able to wait that long.	9	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

We have practice @DATE1, and @DATE3. We also have six girls including me. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves .On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at @NUM5:45 pm and they didnt even start until @NUM6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the @DATE2 and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch .We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didnt get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to @NUM12 then quickely we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldnt believe it, only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head as the man announced @CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom pon team then our names over the speakers. The crowed roared as we entered the field. We quickley all reminded our self to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents. After we finished we were automatically huttled around by friends and family. And waiting and being patient wasnt so bad anymore.  It was all worth the wait.	9	12		3				3.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10958	18143	7	When dealing with todlers or the elderly you must have patience. This patience is key when dealing with anyone, but very young and very old need more. Elderly often @MONTH1 become confused, have a hard time hearing you, or just be a bit slower than you. You must practice patience and give them respect. Very young children are confused sometimes too because they are just learning. Toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them to is you have no patience with them and start to yell, Patience is also important for mentally or physically challenged persons. If they are challenged, there is no way that they can help it. Mentally challenged people often don't understand or don't want to do things just like toddlers. Be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks @MONTH1 be hard for them to complete. Be patient with everyone because patience is respect. Fear is not respect. That is how I feel about the word patience.	7	6		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10964	18150	7	One @DATE1 @TIME1 I was very patient when I was waiting for my sister in law to tell my brother to tell us we could come in the hospital room and see their brand new baby @CAPS1. My father and mother were waiting with my sister, bother and I, in the waiting room / lobby. At the time it was probably for an hour and a half waiting. I guess that I could say that I was being patient. Also very ten to fifteen minutes I would have to get up and walk around. I was so shaky nervous and jumpy. But it probably didn't help that I drank three cans of pepsi and right before rushed to the time I was being patient.	6	8		2				2.0	1.0	1.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10965	18151	7	Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. Ive been patience many times before. I use to go to the store at the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block. I went in got my stuff and went to the end of the line. A half hour past and it was five minutes til closing time. I get to the window and pay for my things @NUM1 minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing. The owner of the store let me get a total of @NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was house hold things. So being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind.	7	9		2				2.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10967	18153	7	Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. @CAPS1s that? I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1s playing. @CAPS2t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go? I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system @CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. @CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms? my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold ro and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog penny [she is real not fake] @CAPS2 dog bitted out the door and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandmas and grandpas house and rest. We travelled through lots of roads until we got to the highway. @CAPS1s gonna be a long ride I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. Daring @CAPS2 nap @CAPS2 parents [@CAPS2 mom] took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasnt nice. We now have one more state to go through and then were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and ate breakfast. Then on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. Longest five hours even but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned his gos and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient.	8	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10974	18163	7	Theres many times Ive been patient @CAPS1 this one time, my little sister kept buging me, and I didnt scream at her or hit her. She was asking me to turn on the music and I said no, she through a fit. So I got up and picked her up, and told her to stop before she get hit, in a nice and kind voice. And she stopped. And I told her to sit down and be quiet and watch tv. In closing, that was a time that I was patient with my little sister, by not screaming at her or hitting her when she was desterbing me. I didnt become a mean person at that point. Last but not least that was a time that I was a patient person.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10975	18164	7	Patience for me is when im helping others with their problems so in this story im going describe to you what is patience. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience cause I sit down all the time and help people with their problem. One day at my old school @PERSON1 this girl she was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school she was crying. I went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying the way she doesnt want to be at home because he mom dont let her go nowhere she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion I really felt like I had patience and since that day forward I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems.	11	8		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10985	18174	7	Middleton middle school, Im one of their students. My name is @CAPS1, Im new here, but you @MONTH1 think that Im a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard @CAPS16 Im not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1s class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. @CAPS2. @CAPS3 said. my names @CAPS4. @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. @CAPS2. I said back. Im @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1. @CAPS8, uh @CAPS1. @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS11 let me show you around. @CAPS12! I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boys name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just wouldent let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, @CAPS13s @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this. @CAPS15? @CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 couldent do same thing. @CAPS16 you just dont have any patience! I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 couldent understand. @CAPS17 be that way  @CAPS1! @CAPS3 said storming out of the room. @CAPS4 wait! I cried but I hat to run after her. @CAPS20, please you dont get @CAPS13. You cant keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its @CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before? I asked ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. @CAPS21. @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again.	12	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

10986	18175	7	I was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1s gold minny van. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said @CAPS6re leaking trannie fluid. @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). @CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip I said to @CAPS2, @CAPS6 dont know that for sure he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didnt help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 werent sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car.	10	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10988	18178	7	Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, Ill be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least Ill have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so Im not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, Im going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, shes transferred everything, Ive proved Im deticated, Ive kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, Ive been watching the neighbors pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and Im working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, Ive been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isnt sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. Ill probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, Ill have to continue everything Im doing now. So, I wont be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!	11	11		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

10997	18187	7	A time I was patient was in @DATE1 at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was about @NUM1 in the @TIME1 when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about @NUM2 minutes till the first @PERSON1 came on stage, the name of their @PERSON1 was @LOCATION2. Their appearance was strange so they looked like a rock @PERSON1. But they were just a regular @PERSON1 that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next @PERSON1 was one I new lots about; their name is the @PERSON1, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was @PERSON2, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about @LOCATION1 and never stoped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about @NUM3 @CAPS1 at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named @CAPS3. And there was strobe lights and regular lights every were. The staid that was holding the drum even moved. It did @NUM4?, and a @NUM5. It went @NUM2 feet in the air and did flips and everything you can @CAPS4. Their lead singer @PERSON3 and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about @NUM7 it was amazing. I will probly never whiteness something like that ever again!	12	9		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

10998	18189	7	Being patient is hard sometimes but easy others. Like @CAPS1 for example. I always get up really early on @CAPS1 morning and lay on the couch. Same with my brother. We get up round @NUM1 am and turn on the @CAPS1 tree. Then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open. First we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle. We do that until we both end upon the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed. But it does no use because we never do. Then about @NUM2 am we start getting gosy. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch. About @NUM3 am we go into our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need there coffee before we open presents. then we go and wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally about @NUM4 min later they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end.	11	11		3				2.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11003	18194	7	One time in @DATE1, I was taking a test called the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS1). Me, and my friends get down with the @ORGANIZATION1 early. So we had to be patient too. We had alot that we could do, but the choices were limited. Being patient is hard, sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really @NUM1 minutes have gone by, sometimes patience requiers a lot of mental peace. One time me, and my dad were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late @NUM2 minutes, but it felt like a few weeks. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal, the audience was patient enough so that the team could score a goal. A bad patience is when youre late to work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait. Sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game, with a kid or with yourselves. So you see that patience can be good or bad, also requiers a lot of mental peace. @ORGANIZATION1.	7	6		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11007	18198	7	Being patient is hard and not all people are patient, but patience is an important thing to do. You have to be patient almost everywhere you go, like waiting in line is being patient. You have to be patient with people to, like people who are learning or you are teaching. I was patient in @ORGANIZATION1 which was really hard to do. When I was really little mabey four or five years old, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. My older sister wanted to go on a ride but I couldnt go because I was to short. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my @CAPS1 went on the ride. I was so sad but my mom told me to wait and not get antcy. After a while I started asking When is the ride going to be over mama she kept responding I dont know, when ever @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 get off the ride. @CAPS2 I couldnt wait, but when my @CAPS1 and sister got off they told my mom that they wanted to go again. My mom said ok and thats when I got sad then she said to me but because you waited so long and nicely I will take you to get a smoothy. I love smoothys I scream. Patience is important, because I was so patient my mom got me something I love. Patience ia a hard thing to do but once you got it, its a good thing to do.	9	11		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11008	18200	7	"Last year I went to the doctors to get a normal check up wen she tested my vision and hearing and felt the cold too. She put on my chest to see if my heart was @CAPS1.K. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy cold fingers on my neck about a minute had passed and she says she will be right back. Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks ""what's going on here"". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a theiroid which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous I had butterflys  really bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour they called me in and I sat down the nurse said everything will be fine. So i trusted her she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm it sorta hurt like a pinch then @NUM2 @NUM3 @NUM4 and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube really cool then we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious and they called my mom which  took about a year not really could not tell by her expression then she said no and that was so happy and I was being patient which was what kept me from not wanting to run down there and seeing myself!"	11	8		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11010	18202	7	One time my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is being understanding and lisksent through difficultis without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to cedar point on vacation. We had fun all day end at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that ment the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cast was coming down. But the blue cast wasnt coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a birds eye  of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cast plummed down. Finally,, he got a ride. Each ride got free season passes to cedar point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience.	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

I told my dad can I go to the doctor because I feel sick???? @CAPS1 he said we will leave @NUM1 am and it was @NUM2 am. Then, I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, my dad and my mom were talking showers. After that, I wanted to yell and complain because they were going too slow and tried acting @CAPS1 beautiful. @CAPS1 I didnt. When they finished they had to look for the keys until they found it. It was @NUM3 am and my dads favorite music was on @CAPS1 we stayed and watched the whole movie. In the middle, it was @NUM4 am and then we went to the doctor and had to stay waiting for everyone to get there turn until it was @NUM5 which is our turn. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me and it was nothing. @CAPS1 I left and I still waited until my brothers finished. In the end, I was @CAPS1 pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said Are you happy? You said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you. @CAPS1 we went home thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself I learned my lesson and it is if you are patient the day can go fast.	12	8		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11019	18212	7	Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is very difficult for me, because I am not patient at all: t cannot wait for things. During school, I am always looking at the clock. I just cant wait for class to be over most of the time. Some times I think I rush things a little bit too much. I wish I was patient, but Im not. Im not patient because I think about what comes after the waiting, I get too curious. For example: in class I get excited for when the day ends. Some day, I want to improve on my waiting style. I dont think that will happen anytime soon.	5	9		2				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	2.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11020	18213	7	Patience is very important at my house. My mother always says you have to be able to patient to succed in anything. One time I was at home on the computer. I was surfing the web and enjoying it. My mom yelled across the house for me to come see her. I got out of my chair. Walked through the kitchen, through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to @CAPS1 to get some groceries. She was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make myself a sanawich. She replied yes and left. While she was gone I cleared my room. Folder laundry and watched television. It was about @DATE1 and she still wasnt home. I was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her. I was tempted to call her but then I remembered what she always says be patient to succed. About a half an hour @DATE1 she got home. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating she told me she was proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more of it.	11	11		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11021	18215	7	Patients in my way of saying is a person that waits awile if she needed to. The only reason im putting this in my own way is because know one is patient in my family. Pations is s person where if they were stuck in traffic then theyll be able to sit and wait or theres a really long wait or line. Or theyll be able to wait for something they need. Patients is just waiting for my turn I should put it. Its about waiting if I have to or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it. Thats what patients mean to me in my own way.	4	4		1				1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11022	18217	7	I am going to tell you about a time I was impatient. I had been working everyday in the @DATE1. I was trying to do the best I could to make make money. I was saving up to by a three hundred dollar bow, a firty dollar target, forty dollar broadbands, and other hunting accessories. I was finding myself to get more impatient everyday. Slowly I was getting tired of working, bored of saving money, and tempted to spend it. Finally I saved up enough money. I bought my stuff. I practiced all day long. Soon I became more accurate. I was ready to go hunting. The first night I was out I passed up a doe at eight yards. I havent had anything close enough to shoot since then.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11025	18220	7	One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didnt happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides. I was running to fast and I couldnt stop. I went head-first  into the wall. It was a brick wall too. I didnt panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didnt take long. Lastly I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1 . We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1 but I cant remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade. It happened because I couldnt stop in time. When I hit my head it didnt hurt. When I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didnt hurt. But I had massive headache. I was glad when everything was over.	10	11		3				3.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11027	18222	7	I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can remember was waiting in a long line for opening of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 for this @DATE1. The line must have at least @NUM1 people. This is one of the largest apple orchard in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also. Her name is @PERSON1. The opening was going to be at @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, the line still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every @NUM3 second. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally, it was @NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! @CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 more minutes. Im sorry. Thanks for your cooperation click. I heard everyone in the line groan. A lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1 and I just sat down to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! @CAPS4 once again! Are you ready for some @CAPS3? Then come on in! Its time for @CAPS3 @CAPS9! That was my story of being patient.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4. so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient.	11	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

Every once and a while my brothers and sister and l are just kind of hard to handle. We where on our way to church when my brother and l started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason, we always bicker and bother each other. My littlest brothe and my sister where frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like he stuck his tongue out at me she pinched me. Then we finally got to church l guess my mom figure it would stop once we got there, but no my three year old brother @PERSON1 repeatedly ran around and threw the church. My oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and l kept talking with my friends. I know l would not be nearly that patient with anyone. So that is why l think my mom is so patient. After church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after we realized how patient she was we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave.	8	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11047	18243	7	During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didnt know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didnt know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didnt say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who dont know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes wont go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since Im not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didnt once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didnt yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldnt have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I wouldve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. Im amazed at my moms understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flue shots like every other year when we got in the car to go I kept saying do we really have to go of  course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a little bit my mom had to get the papers so I just standed there and watched the fish swim around then my mom said lets go in the waiting room. After that she said I had been very patient for waiting except for in the car when I was whinning. So I said thanks and when are we going to get in there. Then when we finally get in there I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions the the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm she said you are like almost the only one of are kid patients that has it been patient.

It is when you can do hardstuff with out feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience is when you can do things with ease you can do it without difficulties.

Also people are very happy around this time of year. I always become impatient waiting for @CAPS1 to @CAPS6. This year I was going to be patient. @CAPS4 I started being patient by going with my mom to go buy new light @CAPS1 tree, and to buy presents for my family. While we were shopping there were all kinds of people in the store. @CAPS4 when got to the checkout line there were a lot of people in line. My mom told me too be patient, @CAPS4 I did. When we finally got out of the store we rushed home to start decorating. I put up the blow up @LOCATION1 which was taking a very long time, but I had to be patient. Finally it @CAPS6 to making the cookies, which was the best part. We cut the dough and put them into the oven. It was taking a long time for them to cook. My mom said as patient can. ''@CAPS4 I was patient and the cookies were eventually all fasted with sprinkles on them. With everything made and put up we were ready for @CAPS1. ''@CAPS6 on @CAPS1,'' I said to myself. I need to be patient or @CAPS1 will never @CAPS6. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS10 everyone came over and had dinner with us, and got their presents I bought them. As everyone left I walked to my room not remembering that it was @CAPS1 @CAPS10. Then when I woke up late, and everyone was waiting for me I got excited: @CAPS13 I was patient and it payed off.	12	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11070	18266	7	One day me and my brother went hunting at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didnt see anything but we werent going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like  a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didnt hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didnt see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didnt get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie.	12	9		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

The maverick, milleniur force, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and the mentis. When I walked in, I knew this way going to be fun. Right as we walked in we saw the @CAPS2, but the line was huge and we decided to go a back later. As the day goes on we go almost of the @CAPS1. As we approach the @CAPS4 we see at least @NUM3 people in line, so there goes our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we arrive at the @CAPS2 the line was bigger then the start of the day. We discussed and decide it's not getting any smaller and go on the ride. About a later a @NUM4 years guy is with his mom. On the back of his shirt is a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it is. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride. The ride was amazing and deserved the wait.

11078	18276	7	The time I was patient was when my sister droped my phone in kool-aid. I was going to get a new one, but it was depending on my behavior. That means I had to be extra good and patient. Everyday for the rest of that week I was good. I still didnt get a new phone so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her faught, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I had to be patient. Another week went by, and I was starting to become impatient, but I didnt. The next day my sister took me into the metro pcs store to pick out a new phone. See by being patient I finally got a new phone, and thats the time I was patient.	9	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11079	18277	7	A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient excepcially when it is all sold out. For example when I was waiting in line for a shirt the line was really long so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patient because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and their were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many ways we had to be patient like parking getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break I went to get a pop and all the lines where long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case that wasn@CAPS1 mine. I went back drank my pop and watched the show. Everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient.	9	9		2				2.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	1.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11081	18279	7	A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about @NUM1 people in the dance room. I worked very hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didnt get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldnt get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but dont give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them.	12	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11084	18282	7	A time were I was patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before I got my broken foot. I was waiting for about an hour and a half. It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and I just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half. Finally the nurse said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can be hard sometimes but everybody can have patients.	10	10		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper.	8	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11086	18284	7	Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. @CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments  @CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so @CAPS2 is right not having patients @CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 is part of your daily life.	5	6		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11088	18286	7	Sixty nine days ago @CAPS1-three miners in chile got stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didnt panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners.	12	8		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11093	18291	7	What is patience? Patience is the act of thing understanding, tolerate and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient.	11	11		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11096	18294	7	Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, youre quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when youre waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates arent doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that youve lost, and youve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened Ive experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what Im trying to say is that when youre patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isnt a bundle of roses all the time, so soon or later, youre going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isnt human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, Im certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently.	9	7		2				0.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11103	18302	7	One day when the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 came out I wanted it so bad so I asked my mom and she said maby for @CAPS2 and guess what @CAPS2 was coming up. It was @DATE1 and I couldnt wait so I went to school and I got it over with every day and I kept coming there and saying Im for sure that I will get a @ORGANIZATION1 just like mom and thats about the handreth time I said that to her and she said  you have to be patient or I will probley never even get it for you because you have a little brother around and if he hears you say saying I want this and that hes going to think @LOCATION1 is not real so be patient. Well for the past few days I started being patient and I had to be patient for a while because it was only @DATE2 to and I went to school and of course it was stupid and a waste of time but I didnt care because I was about to get a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 so I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. well I know one thing I am lucky for not asking for a @CAPS3 for the past few days Im being patient I really cant believe it I really never been patient anytime except for now when Im getting something awesome. So now I have only @NUM1 more days antil @CAPS5 so Im really exited.

11105	18304	7	Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesnt listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesnt have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect! In summary patience is one way element to life.	7	6		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

Many people cannot patiently wait to see a @CAPS1. another example is @CAPS3 when familys go on a road trip you here @CAPS3 say mom when are we gonna get there, and that is my weakness we, well that is a sign of no patience.

11109	18308	7	Some people a completely patient. Some people arent patient at all. But me; I sort of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patientce, I think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If its @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When were going somewhere special, or Im trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! Its like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I cant always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when Im cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though Im super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a  natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesnt come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you dont have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Dont get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenegers arent always patient either. I think we should just try to be patient as we can, all the time!	6	6		2				1.0	1.0	1.0	3.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11112	18311	7	This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though Im empty on the inside, i goess. Theres gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. Hes always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. Hes useless now, but Im patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that its not just @CAPS2 who Im waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sight. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me hed seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasnt just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. Hes gone hasnt showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. Im patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. Im still waiting for a hello.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

Not complaining , not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did.

My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I turned nine I went to a friends home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and feels. I didnt have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something bigs tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water. A reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldnt break. Finilly I held the fish high over my head in a triumghant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years.	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	3.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didnt say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often dont meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  @CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of youngs incorporated.  @CAPS3, youre with youngs?  @CAPS4 asked.   Do you know where the show room is?  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation?  @CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.  I said in a robotic voice.  @CAPS6t  you a little young to be doing this kind of work?  @CAPS4 asked.  You were expecting maybe an intern?  I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent  @CAPS8, sir.  @CAPS9 old are you?  @CAPS4 asked quizzically.  @CAPS11, sir. I lied.  I knew I could pass for a high schooler,  so I knew @CAPS4d  believe me.  I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. Are you getting paid?  @CAPS12 enough to put up with the likes of you.  I thought.  I took a deep breath,  and answered,  yes,  sir.  But its @CAPS12 a lot.  Its more like volunteer work,  really.  @CAPS13 dont ask any more questions, I thought.  @CAPS4 smiled and walked on,  thanks son. Youre welcome.  I said through partially clenched teeth.  I think well both agree that I was patient that day.  And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dads shop, because if @CAPS4 didnt, I will be very put out.  That is the time when I was the most patient.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11118	18320	7	Patience when a person is patient the can wait a thousand years   for an answer. Or he/she is understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. I always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time, and keep his cool. That is amazing. Patience is when the person is always their when you need help and he will give you patience by just around him. I think patience is calm, doesnt lose his temper and helps you when you need a little boost of patience	6	6		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11123	18326	7	"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them."	6	5		1				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

I didnt know at first but it came to my head. I told him I wanted to go paint hall shooting. And he said ok. But before we go he said can you cut the grass for me. I said ok. So I cut the grass which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes so I told him Im done and he said ok, so I took a shower because I smelt like wet grass. And when I got done takns my shower I called my friends and cousins to see if they would to come and they said sure. So I asked my dad when are we going to leave to go pointball shooting. He told me it is going to be at a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasnt going to be today. They were ok with it. And my dad said we were going to go before @DATE2 stars and we have went. And now until this day I am still being patient.	9	8		2				3.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11125	18329	7	There are many time @CAPS1 a persons life when someone was being patient. Patient @CAPS1 a very important trait that could lead to it own rewards. I am a dancer at @ORGANIZATION1 of dance. There @CAPS1 a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pieroette. Everyone who @CAPS1 in the class @CAPS1 so patient when these events happen. It @MONTH1 take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak @CAPS2, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog @CAPS1 a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, @CAPS1 a sign of being under control and patient? Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and confortability to others. Not to mention, it @CAPS1 what @CAPS1 respectful. Like I said, being patient @CAPS1 a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it.	5	9		2				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

The wind and snow was terrible I was counting the number of teachers and people who left the school I was so bored. My face was red as a cherry. So I started reading to pass time but my fingers started getting cold and I was dreaming of all the hot things in the world. First it was hot choclate then @DATE1 then it was florida in @DATE1 on a hot day. But I was staying patient as I could but it was vary hard. I was cold as ice and I dug into my pack to find something warm and I found some gloves to go with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves so my fingers did not freeze. Then I see a red car looking like my moms car and then it passed a wave of grief swept over me and I could not take any more! But when I stood up a car pulled in and it was my mom I got my stuff in the car and put the heaters on high and my mom said thanks for being patient.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

It takes her a little longer to ge things because she @MONTH1 where she her own little would but it not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with truninig wheels but she tryed and she still know how today shes gotten way better but still has brain problems. So Im taking her from horrible to better to good then to great. Shes improved over the years it takes patience because she has a disorder. So you really dont yell at her cause shes very emotional and sencitive so you have to be quiet, nice, and have patience.

11162	18369	7	Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didnt care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldnt believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but Im still alive, right? My friends dont know me to have patience and I dont either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again. Ever.	8	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

She kept on telling me to sit still, but she never got mad at me, even if she had really wanted to just stop and make me get it out myself.

11186	18396	7	There was a kid named @PERSON2 who was always very patient. He always waited for every else and he never complained. That morning @PERSON2 just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bath rooms were taken up but @PERSON2 didn't complain he actually used up that time to clean his room and make his bed. @PERSON2 was a little bit late to school. The @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 said come here and the class said ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! @PERSON2 is in trouble. @PERSON1 said come here and @PERSON2 put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton. During lunch @PERSON2 was at the end of the line. Once @PERSON2 had gotten up there, there was no more food it was all gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch. Once @PERSON2 got home his family threw a patient party. @PERSON2 was honered and also happy.

11187	18398	7	As my dad allways tells me, patient is one of the vary begs to being successful in life. As I mature I find out more and more that patients is important. I remember a time when I had to display patients for a long period of time. My family and I took a trip to ceadar point along with my friend. My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1 ride gave me the most fan, heartstopping, andrenalin pumping rush ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, I began to get tired. After @NUM1 hours of walking we reached the mellenium @ORGANIZATION1. I was disapointed to find out its a @NUM1:30 hour wait. The sun was blazing out. I figure the best way to do @CAPS1 was to keep quiet and relax. It seems that the more you complain the longer it takes. And before we knew it we were about to get to get on the ride!	10	9		3				2.0	2.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

I said in a disappointed tone I gusse we can wait, but in my head I reminded myself you have zero, zipo, none no patience! Why did I say yeah. Right when my thoughts were done the line moved up a little. That was quick I thought. During that time to the time the line moved again I had occupied myself by watching people on the @CAPS3 and other rides go by. The line moved up again. Watching people didnt work this time, so I was thinking of how much fun the maverick would be to ride, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted half way in the line. My patience was running out. I started thinking about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how I didnt want to go back, what I would miss, and was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing patience every seconde. I started to tap my fingers on the side of my leg. I thought nothing and just tapped my fingers and move up. We were finally at the front, and I didnt complain once! I got into a seat, and the ride started. At the end I was really worth it I thought. Now it was time to go on more rides and not complain.

It is like a @NUM1 hour drive threw @LOCATION2 and that is the way we went, I was sitting in the back of the car and I had an ear ake so my ear was hearting and I had to wait @NUM1 hours. Another reason is my little brother @PERSON1 was trying to grab my feet, and take his stuffed animal and hitting me with it. I would tell him to stop and he would not so eventully I took the stuffed animal and he would yell at me to give it back so I would. The last reason is we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in a line so we could get back into the @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2.

My mother, sister, a friend of hers and mall piled into car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2.  My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11198	18411	7	I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help on something like school work or homework. Some of them take awhile to explain to and I must use patience in order to help them. And I'll be realistic, not everyone has a lot of patience and get frustrated easily, like me sometimes. And at times I have been on the phone for a hour trying to explain homework to one of my friends. Soon I will once again have patience when I tutor for @CAPS1.

But I have to wait because I dont want to jungle pee so I will wait. I also have to wait for my bust. I hate waiting its so boring. But patience is a good thing to have.

11206	18419	7	A beaker bubbled in @LOCATION1 lab. I could smell the sulfur smell wafting from the beaker. @CAPS1 whats going on! I yelped across the room @CAPS2 found the cure for the cancer! @CAPS3 said as @CAPS3 had a little jublee dance that @CAPS3 showed off. I am a doctor and I wasnt so sure but I told him I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. @CAPS4s go try it out! @CAPS3 screamed. As I zoomed to the car and waited while @CAPS3 packed up his lab equiptment. After @NUM1 minutes I was pondering where @CAPS3 could be. @CAPS3s just having a hard time packing up I said. So I turned on the radio and fell asleep. After a couple hours I woke up in shock. I had been sleeping @NUM2 ½ hours! I rushed inside to find him holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. I saved this kittens life with my cure for cancer. @CAPS3 said out of breath. I was glad I was patient or the kitten would have not lived. Just as I was thinking about how nice it was that @CAPS3 saved the kitten, my pager dinged. @PERSON1, the lady with extreme brain cancer needed our help. @CAPS3 got one vial of his cancer solution and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw @PERSON1 laying there as translucent as light hitting off paper. I quickly got her heart rate down. At this moment I wasnt sure if she would live. @CAPS6 give it to her? the mad scientist asked. I made a risky choice. @CAPS7, not yet. I waited five minutes and then poured it in. @PERSON1 came back to life. Even though @PERSON1 couldnt talk, I could tell by her smile that she was very thankful I was patient. Her daughter walked into the room and said, @CAPS8 you.

It was my first time getting shots, and I didnt know how it felt. Since I was little, it was harder for me to have patience, I just wanted it over with. I kept on asking my dad is the doctor coming yet, and my dad would always say patience. It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys; which I did not notice until then. But when I saw those fun toys gleaming in the sunlight I ran to them. But after a few minutes it got so boring, so I went back and sat down. It was getting so boring I couldnt take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldnt take it, I started to get so mad, wanted to just get out of there. But I didnt let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out, and said @CAPS1, and I was releved that the doctor finally came to give me shots. But what I didnt know was that I was going getin horrible pain for a few days.	11	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11209	18423	7	I play hockey. I am a goalle. A good goalle is always paitient. On my old hockey team me and the other goalle faced lots of @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots. Most of the @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots didnt matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was @NUM1 to @NUM6 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a @NUM1 on @NUM1 against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stoped it. That was even of the only shots of the game and I stoped it.	10	8		2				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11210	18424	7	@CAPS1 on hurry up, my friend said. I know, be patient, I said. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences without complaining. One day, we had a basketball game away at a different school. My team and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last one to go into a stall. They all left and one girl stayed.

11214	18429	7	Patience. Patience is something I have absolutly nothing of! I take after my mom in this area. My mom is probably a little bit worse than me but we are both pretty bad. Sometimes we record t.v. shows and watch them later just because we dont want to have to wait through the @CAPS1. Some of the other things I hate to wait through are lines, people being late and just plain old waiting around. The longest amount of time I can stay patient for is about five minutes any  longer than that puts me over the edge. On by the way another thing is long car rides when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a @NUM1 hour drive turn into a @NUM1 minute drive but still end up at the same place. I really wish icould have more patience but I dont know how to get it. I really hope that you have enough patience to get through my story.	7	8		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	1.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats.

11223	18442	7	I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room in the doctors office with my mom because I wasnt feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said @CAPS1 its already been ten minutes I wonder when I will get to go and talk to my doctor. I said. I don.t know but lets wait a bit longer. Mom said. So as we waited and sat patiently more kids started coming in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I signed. What is taking so long? I wandered. Was my doctor even here today? I starred at the wall and looked at the color of it. Orange. Before I knew it half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. @CAPS1 its almost @NUM1! @CAPS2! I said flustered and annoyed. Are we just gonna sit here all day? I asked. Finally my question was answered as a nurse said I could finally come back to a room and speak with my doctor about my sickness. @CAPS3 for being patient! the nurse said smilling. I smiled back.

11225	18445	7	Patience can come in different was in life. For one thing, it can reward you at the end. For example, it can come in a bigger way if you are patient because it would be a bigger reward to you. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process. For example you could wait for something, you could do something else when its time you deserve it. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if your calm. For example, people cant wait so they just want to rush and get to be done with it. My final reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy. For example, the second wouldnt be so hard because you would be calm. That is patience in my own way.	5	4		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11227	18448	7	In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I am going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle @PERSON1. I didnt get to sleep in very much, I still got up at about the same time I do to go to school. I had to get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasnt going with us. We got in the car, and drove to my uncle @PERSON1s house. When we arrived at his house, my dad started packing everything onto the boat. Once we did that, we hopped in my uncle @PERSON1s old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck. We started to drive, and my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep watching  the boat. The boat was very small. It just barely fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 foot long. It scared me when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We went through a gorgeous river all the way to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 were on is called @ORGANIZATION1. It is in @LOCATION1. I was patient right when we got in there. I thought we were going to stand, so I was having second thoughts on fishing. It turns out, we just sat in there while we fished. We fished for a good @NUM2 hours that day. I was so very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. @CAPS1 my uncle @PERSON1 said. It means that the bobber is going under the water like a submarine does. We had @NUM2 rods out at once! @NUM4 pike rods, and @NUM1 bluegill rods! I caught the biggest blue gill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life!! That is about the time I had to be patient on the @ORGANIZATION1 for @NUM2 hours straight.	9	10		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11229	18450	7	Two summers ago, I helped out with kids camp at my church. I helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. They were very exited and roudy. They were always running around and shouting. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later on this week, I was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldnt sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted. It was hard to stay calm. Dispite the hardship I managed to be patient and calm. The little boy decided  I was all right and started to behave. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway he sais, hi! very excitedly. Now am glad that I stayed patient.	10	10		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11232	18454	7	Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this during a visit to the dentists office. This @DATE1, I had a dentist appointment, since it had been six months since my last one. As I was waiting to be called in, a boy came in with a severe toothache. The dentists decided to treat him first. I understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older women came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision. After the women went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girls tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy she had a loose tooth. I didnt it was fair that I had to wait another @NUM1 minutes so that she could get her tooth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience because my appointment got pushed back over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, and then I didnt mind her going in front of me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be manditory.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I dont have any patients in grocery shopping I cant wait to get out but, everyone hates it right? Lines, lines, lines man do I hate them the take forever, wherever you go. Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just cant help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you dont complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especillaly, when you are in a difficult situation it helps to have patient people than non-patient people with you. Well that talks about patients and how people deal, relate, and chill about it.	6	5		1				0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11235	18458	7	I remember the time I got my new puppy we had to be patient. We had to be patient because, he wasnt fully paddy trained yet and he was crazy. My dog is @CAPS1 and they are known for herding cows .So whenever we used to go outside he would bite our shoes. I dont know  why it would try to move us but it did .We had to be very patient when we trained him, it took until he was @NUM1 and a half years out to figure out that he wasnt supposed to do that  but on (my dog) is still growing into new hobbies. We just have to stay calm and patient and then we are able to train him. It takes a long time for @CAPS2 dop to brave his hobbies, so we must stay patient.

It kind of worked but once in awhile it came back to me. Although I did stay patient and I didnt bug my parents about it once. It took a few years, but I keept my patience. Sometimes I even forgot I forgot about it. I just lived every day as if I didnt care about @LOCATION1. No mater how tempting it was seing @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 hawks game on I kept my cool. Then it happened @MONTH1 @DATE1, imagen that it was @NUM1 and I was still patient!

11247	18473	7	I am going to tell a story in my own way. It was @DATE1. My sister was turning @NUM1 years old. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was carling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said You have wait. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, if was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, @NUM2 cousins and I all had @NUM3 @CAPS2 to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list @CAPS3 I had to be patient for awile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and water. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, shes @CAPS3 slow, @CAPS3 I walked up there and shouted, @CAPS4 up! I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of be patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games. Thats my story I told in my own way.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11248	18474	7	A  time that i was patient was when i had to train my dog. sit boy, I command to my puppy. My dog instead of sitting runs at me jump and grabs the treat out of my hand. I go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down. While @CAPS1 walking  to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolts away. After chasing him for hours he finally stops and looks at me waiting  to run again. @CAPS2 here Im done chasing you lets just go for a walk, please, I say as i slowly loose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again just leaving a bunch of dust behind. @CAPS1 done ! I scream and walk away with anger. I begin to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning @CAPS4 up and go outside to try and train dog.  I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today @CAPS1 ready to work hard and keep my patience. @CAPS6! I yell waiting  for my dog to @CAPS2 running and he does.With my first command i tell the dog to sit and he does not so I dont give him the treat. I say it again and he sits! Finally some progress after that waiting. I give him the treat and he starts waging his tail. To see if he understood i say it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that work with my dog I begin to  ask him to do more things,sometimes he doesnt listen and some times he does. That was a  time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him and it definently paid off.	10	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

Every body is on the edge of their chairs waiting, why does @CAPS4 seem so long? Its almost @NUM1 minute now.the aroma of peperoni  pizza is so strong that I can practicly taste @CAPS4. This is agony. My stomach rumbles, so hungry. @NUM2 seconds can I wait that long @NUM3 Iâm not sure. The tension ogf the whole class is so great,I think my brain will erupt.

Iâm not a very patient, not at all. But do I have any amount of patience? If I do Iâm not seeing @CAPS4 got. Iâm about to just jump out of my seat as if Iâm ejected from a @DATE1. Iâm trying to hold still, but anxiety is getting to me. If I knew that Iâd be this anxious for lunch that I would have had breakfast. Were down to @NUM6 seconds now. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. @CAPS4âs enough to crush me now. I think I might make @CAPS4 @NUM7. My stomach rumbles again,brouse this time, begging for food, @CAPS5, demanding is more like @CAPS4. â@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,âthe clock nocking me, taunting me @NUM8 seconds I canât bare this much longer. I think am about to snap. I donât handle patience well. @CAPS4âs a ticking bomb inside me, just waiting to go off @NUM9 seconds. @CAPS4 seems the bomb and clock are counting down together.

I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So instead of complaining I stopped thinks about how long of would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 second long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headace. So I shut my mouth. I was glad that I was patient that day. Because if I wouldn't have been the my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at end the day.	11	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11256	18482	7	Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it,  patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and @CAPS1 my patience was before a @ORGANIZATION1 football game. One part was driving there. It was @NUM1 and people were migrating to @PERSON1! It took us @NUM2 to go @NUM3! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game!@CAPS1 your patience!my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there , having overcome my rushed feeling and letting  patience take over me.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

We go to the small town of @PERSON1 right next to famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me Im not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to launch of our patience.

11260	18489	7	My grandma is almost always patient with me, especially when she is teaching how to do something like cook or sew. One time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to chang the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, even though it took a while and Im not the best listener, that took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very invoked because either the cookie broke or my frosting was lumpy and all over the cookie even the bottom, but grandma put up with my complaining and when I finally frosted on that didnt break and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make carmol corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, bat she also let me make the sauce on the last batch which was fun, and when I started to go to slow, instead of yealing at me to harry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker which must of taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took a @CAPS1 amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda, anything in the recipe that could be dropped I dropped it, I also never wanted to stay clean it up and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor. My grandma is always patient with me no matter what I do.	12	9		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

The clock showed @NUM1, I for sure new that I wasnt going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my @NUM2 and took deep breathes.

Relax, youll make it there. @CAPS7 of a sudden my @CAPS1 slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read @NUM3. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself see you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and @CAPS7 you had to do was slow down and @CAPS5 passient.

11285	18515	7	@PERSON1 and his dad were planning on going fishing on that @DATE1 @TIME1. They got everything they needed fishing pots. Tackle box, fishing nets, bait, and lunch. They drove down to the lake, got into their small rowboat and were off. @PERSON1's dad was the first to catch something. He caught a ten inch small mouth bass. It was too small so he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake was quiet today. There was a small breeze in the @DATE2 air. The sun was up but it was still a little cold. The sat there quietly, patiently. @PERSON1's dad got another pull on his line. He quickly reeled it in. this time he caught a twenty inch pike. Another one too small so he threw it back. ''The fish are really biting today hu?'' said his dad. But the truth was they had been out there for an hour and @PERSON1 hadn't gotten a bite. They fished for another hour or so before taking a break to eat lunch. They just brought sand wiches, chips, and a few waters. When they were done eating they went back to fishing. @PERSON1 casted his line as far as he could get it to go. He sat and waited for about twenty minutes when he finally got a tug on his line. ''I got one. I got one,'' he told his dad trying to reel his line in as fast as could. When he got it in the boat, they measured it. @PERSON1 caught a fourteen inch largemouth bass. ''@CAPS1 like you caught dinner for tonight ''. Said his dad. They stayed out about twenty more minutes then went in with a fish dinner @PERSON1's patients caught him a good fish.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11287	18517	7	As  I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I was six and foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on christmas. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as Im older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I dont care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and dont want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and dont say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taughht to act, so please take my words into consideration, they could help.	8	6		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11291	18521	7	Well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago. When I had to keep a tremendous amount of patience. Well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text. I accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page! I am so glad I had such a caring teacher that found that for me or I wouldve failed! When I was sitting down at my desk quietly she (The teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face. I knew that meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page. I almost flipped out but I held it back. I think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right.

I went downstairs with a couple blankets and tried to go to sleep when I saw the huge amount of stuff just sitting there. I sat up and looked around at them. I was so excited but I remembered that I would have to wait until everyone woke up. So I tried to go back to sleep. I would close my eyes and sleep for about four minutes at a time and eventually stopped trying. It was @NUM2 am. I turned on the @CAPS5, threw in a movie, and waited.

11303	18534	7	One time my friend told me to read this book, so l borrowed it from her. The name of the book is called The @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Its also a tv show on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was reading the books and one of the main characters named @PERSON2, brother of @PERSON1 are vampires. They turned into a @CAPS1 because of a girl named @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 died because they were trying to save @PERSON3, or so everyone thought. @PERSON3 gave them enough blood so they wouldnt die, they would become a @CAPS1. They thought @PERSON3 was in the tume because that was were everyone was taking the vampires because the town found out there was vampires there. @PERSON2 came back after @NUM1 years searching for something to help get @PERSON3 out of the tume, I think that is patience. Waiting for @NUM1 years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble. He waited a long time.

11305	18536	7	When I was @NUM1 years old my mother and sister were working and cleaning around the house and I kept asking my @CAPS3 can we go to get pizza? @CAPS1 every time I asked she would reply, if you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizza. I didnt want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, @CAPS1 after @NUM2 minutes, it got boring. After that, thats when I knew I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water. @CAPS1 I was still bored.

I walk to my bike and got my helmet which is sitting on my bike seat. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, @CAPS1 somehow driving up and down the drive way was more entertaining than cleaning. I hop of my bicycle and ran into the house, taking two immediate lefts after entering the house I look up at the clock, @NUM3.m it said. My family always has dinner at @NUM1:35 because my dad gets home from work at @TIME1 and cooks dinner.

11307	18538	7	Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didnt have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that its most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely want get things done. Most of my family and I dont have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have.	6	12		2				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

So @CAPS5 started scream. As you can imagine when @CAPS5 and @PERSON1âs @CAPS8 @PERSON2 heard this she ran to @CAPS5 and @PERSON1. She questioned @CAPS5 with a worried look on her face. She said to @CAPS5 â@CAPS5 dear, what are screaming about?

Every where you go you need some patience. You will not have any friends when you do not be patient. Patience will grow you in life. Lets just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office by two days. So when you do go you have to get your ticket number and sit, it might be for hours, but you cant just leave because if you do, you want get what you. Heres another example lets just say if you had to go to the doctor because your sick, you have to wait, you should because what if the doctor make you go pick up the medicine, @CAPS1 are some results about patience.	6	6		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11321	18553	7	Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever.  Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you dont have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to suceed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday.	6	5		1				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11324	18557	7	Back when I was in about third grade I had to be really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field. I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably couldve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field.	8	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11325	18558	7	For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunters orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in its place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience. Patience @MONTH1 not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things.	12	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients. I understoond because I get that feeling when Im waiting for test results. It is nerve racking and exciting. The next day was not as hard. She just went on with her day. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She had passed the test.

11327	18560	7	"It can be really hard to be patient, depending on the effect. Even I lose my patience some times. But one time I was so patient that I was about to explode. On a dry @DATE1 day, my family and I decide to go on an exciting vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. We drove @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and headed east towards @ORGANIZATION1. After the boring road trip, we parked our silver mini van in a five dollar parking lot right next to the @ORGANIZATION1. First we went up the @CAPS1 tower, where we saw everything from the incredible height. After that we saw our cousins. I never even saw them before. As we were looking at the waterfall my brother said, ""@CAPS2, look at those boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go on them?"" ""@CAPS3, but first we have to buy tickets."" @CAPS4 my dad. We bought the tickets and went in line."" @CAPS5 are there so much people?"" I asked. There was about @NUM1 people waiting in line with us. ""@CAPS6 be patient,"" my dad replied. I stood there looking at all the people in front of us. We were never going to get on the boat. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets. After @NUM2 minutes we still did not get the jackets yet. We were moving as slow as the plates on the earth were. Finally, we got a jacket, but we weren't on a boat yet. My brother was complaining and my dad started yelling at him. I was still standing, almost to explode. At last, they called us up onto the boat. It was amazing going under the waterfall. We were in the mist. When we came back to shore, we talked about how amazing it was. Being patient has a reward at the end. Even though it is hard to be patient, I still did it and anyone can. I was patient the whole time in line to get in the boat. Patience can be rewarding."	12	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I was astonished! I didnt know what to say! At first I thought she was hiding around but when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. ??? When she was done talking to my mom, my mom too was in shock. I was so greatful I could not fall asleep. I ended waking up at @NUM1 am and I was not to fond of that but it was totaly worth it. It was a long two hour drive but when we got there we bought our tickets and ??? the mavric. The line was humumus but we waited. Half way into the line, the ride broke down. I could not believe my eyes. Ive wanted to ride that one for ever. I was ??. We waited patiently for around @NUM2 @NUM3 hours maybe @NUM4. I was hungry, trerd, and cooking in the sun. once it opened up again we only had to wail like ½ hour but all in all, it was worth it. My sister in law @PERSON1 was very impressed on how patiently I waited. And we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever aten. The rest of the day was tremendous but that was defidintly the most patient I was in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and @PERSON1, I think thats why I was so calm.

11332	18565	7	What is patience? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining most people are impatient these days. Patience is like waiting. For example, if you are in a traffic jam in a long line, or maybe you have to wait your turn for something. Patience is one of the best qualities someone could have. Every year more people become impatient. @CAPS1 want people to hurry or move faster. @CAPS1 need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down. I think the world would be more peaceful if everybody had patience there would be no more conflict and if that happened some day, everybodies lives would be perfect.	7	6		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11334	18567	7	Being patient is a very hard thing to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and cedar point was packed. There were flys everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! @CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again I pleaded. @CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait! @CAPS1 quickly replied. @CAPS5! I never get what I want do I! You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much! well I dont wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might! by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didnt get front cart the wait wasnt even that bad.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11335	18569	7	A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didnt understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didnt go with science, and he didnt listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldnt beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; @CAPS1 he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient.	10	12		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient.	7	6		2				1.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 was no where to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, @CAPS1s one mom sweet, she replied. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were steping into the building and we rushed to get the tiketts and the food. The movie was going to start at @NUM1. I was going to start saying something but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours strate. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped the securety said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so exided, the movie was about to start. After the movie was done me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got @CAPS1. This was the story when I used patience.	10	8		2				2.0	3.0	3.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11345	18579	7	I am never patient. Weather its waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend I am never patient. The only time I can be patient is when im waiting for school to start. I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if im waiting for school to start. Then also the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I will run around the house for hours until a friend calls. ?? when they do call I rush right to the phone and answer it right away. I will even sit there and stare at the phone waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient for is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back til bed time so I will never have to clean my room.	8	10		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11347	18581	7	Being patient means that when your in a bad situation you dont complain. Some people arent vary patient and some are very patient. In my eyes patience is very important, I likes to think of myself of sort of patient or I think I am. One time I had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @LOCATION1 it was not fun. One bad thing about it was you always had to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privillage to go when you want get taken away then you want it even more. But I kept saying to myself be patient well stop at the next place. Another thing was you were alway hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times that was not fun. Also whenever you got food was not enough. But I didnt complain. Lastly you just really want to get there you couldnt wait for the sandy beaches and the waves. It seamed like we would never get there it was not the best experience. When we finally got there I realized that the trip was like a big test of patience and I pasted, and actually it wasnt nearly as bad as the trip back.	9	10		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11350	18584	7	Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better.	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11351	18586	7	Patience is a kind thing , people being patient, but still complaining about it thats not patience at all. Patience is waiting and being kind while your doing it. People that loose their patience easily really is not cool, its nice when someone waits for you if say your on the phone talking to someone else, or even on the internet or something. Its very poliete if you have patience, I dont know the definition of it but am just gonna guess, I think its a person waiting patiencently and quietly on the other person even if they need to get somewhere.	5	6		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11353	18588	7	Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you dont. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly @CAPS2 happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldnt stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over stiff upper lip. I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didnt work tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. I want to go home I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said @CAPS2 all grouchy. I had sniffled and said I want to come home, I miss you. and sniffled more. Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready. @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in @LOCATION1s car. @CAPS4 didnt you want to stay? @PERSON5 asked calmly. I dont know. And it wasnt brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks.	11	12		3				2.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11354	18590	7	I had to be patience many times. I had to be patience when my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum, I was waiting for x-rays, waiting to go on stage. These are sometimes when I had to be patience. When my @CAPS1 broke his ear-drum I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the waiting room.  It felt like forever. It was winter, I was in my pjs, and so bored but worried about my @CAPS1. In @NUM1 grade I hit my wrist in a door and a wall. I was in the emergency room for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours, but they were very good at there job. My mom and I were stuck watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on the tv they had. It was very cold in the waiting room plus I had @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my @NUM1 grade concert.  I was so nervous and the neeves kept growing. I waited for @NUM5 min but it felt like @NUM5 years. I was sitting next to my friend which helped a little. When we got on stage I song my heart out and was happy I waited. Those are sometimes which I had to be @NUM7. I am not good at being patience, but I waited and got good results.	8	7		2				1.0	1.0	3.0	3.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11355	18591	7	Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That on main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dogs name is @CAPS1 mae she is three years old and is full blooded pitbull.??? ??? ??? ??. it all started when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for her early check up. The @CAPS6 said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side I t means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. I ran to her and she screamed @CAPS3 is going to have babiesthen I scremed with her. We went and got dixixe and then we took her to the bark play and that night she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever. Well at least it seemed like it. Now @CAPS1 was get bigger. The @CAPS6 said it should be six months atleast until she has the puppies it`s aready been five and half, mom said, that she has milk now I told my sister, @DATE1 . I wouldn`t doubt it, said @DATE1 then we went and took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the @CAPS6 and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies today then I said oh cool but let`s not rush @CAPS1 she`s going through a lot right now. then we said our goodbyes and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said oh your just in time honey @CAPS3 having her babies we both ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 was laying on a blanket, I jotted to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright. I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. The mom @CAPS1 mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cutie, bootsier. Tinker, bella, harmony and melony. I love my dogs!	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

As we got in, the place looked amazing! It was almost like a dream. They even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we went on  was the @ORGANIZATION1. We waited, and waited for about ten minuites and then things got boring. It had been almost fifteen minuites and we werent even close to the ride! So we waited , and waited about ten more minuites, and things got a little faster. At this part, the line was moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenallen already. After we were strapped in, the person who locks peoples seats said go! and we took off like a bird.

11361	18597	7	Have you ever been a patient? Like at the @CAPS1s office?  Well let me tell you a time I have. One time I was really sick and I started crying because I was in a lot of pain. I was crying for an hour straight. Then my mom took me to the hospital where she works. When I got out of the car, I somehow stopped crying. I told my mom that I stopped crying but she told me that I had to go see the @CAPS1.  When we went in we seen this man rushed to the @LOCATION1.  We went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up. When @CAPS1 @PERSON1 came out she asked a man in to see her with his son. That gave us two seat to sit in.  After about @CAPS2 minutes she called us in to a medical room. She examined me and I was really scared because I might have nomonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her office I was holding my moms hand. She came unto us holding piece of paper and my mom asked what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection.  When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to pay. She only had to pay about ? @NUM1. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and went into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full, I felt like a pancake under another pancake.  When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lolly pop. When I got home I took some medicine and went to bed. The following day I woke up and about @TIME1 I got to have the lollypop. That was a time when I was patient.	9	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient.	10	10		3				3.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11364	18600	7	Patience is hard for me. I am simply an impatient person. Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. @CAPS1 you can get it this time. I encouraged myself. I stored at the net. The net was the obstacle. If the net was shorter I would be able to get my volleyball serve over. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward. Thwap!  I struck the ball, but it went barrelling into the net. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I think. You got this! my entire team stared at me. Clunk, clunk. I bounce the ball twice, spin it around once in my hand.

Then when you wait you start something and then as soon as you start its time. Waiting for package is the worst.  You wait and a sit and wait, then you forgot about it and then it comes .One day I was waiting to go to my friend house it felt like forever since Ive seen her but it had only been about ten months .I missed her like crazy .We have been planning this or weeks it was finally the day of get to go over @CAPS1 .Now I was only waiting on my dad to drive me @CAPS1 and he takes forever .Finally we got in the???

But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was.I was @NUM1 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around @NUM2 am on a @DATE1 @TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when a elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The women at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait, @CAPS1 explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My told me to be patient but I didnt know what that meant so @CAPS1 explained it to me. @CAPS1 said, You have to wart quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes. I told her. I could do it and sure enough I could. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be for them also.	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11373	18609	7	Patience is about waiting for something and not complaining about it. When you are patient you wait for something with out complaining. If you are waiting for something and you start to complain that means you don't have much patience. It isn't really good to not have patience. Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't that is not good. If you do have patience that is good, but some people don't and it is not good, because if something that you have to wait for and it is important, and you have no patience that could be bad. Some people have good patience  but sometimes even if you have good patience you can still sometimes complain. And that is what patience is.	6	5		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

The line looked as if it were five miles long ! My mom asked me if I wanted to keep going in the huge line or go next time when less people were there. This is what I had been waiting for ! I was not oppernutity. I told her I wanted to keep going and so we kept walking. It took what felt like two days to get to top. My mom and I were so patient !So we waited ,and waited ,and waited .Till we were finally at the top .Then we came down .It had been worth the wait ! we were so patient.

11388	18626	7	Patience is a virtue. You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Heres a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, Im going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, its very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``@CAPS1 services and goods such as pizza delivery @NUM1 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I cant deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old. That will affect me in very negative way. Those are the pros and cons of having patience thank you for reading my essay.	7	7		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11398	18636	7	Just before @DATE2 break, in the fourth grade, there was a @CAPS1 party at my neighbors house. My parents and I were invited, and since we didnt have plans, we decided to go to the party. The party was spectacular! There were stockings hung over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and huge @CAPS1 tree in the living room. Under the @CAPS1 tree, there was a large pile of presents-each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until @CAPS1 morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didnt understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. Why was the week going by so slowly? As @CAPS1 drew near, I grew impatient. I almost opened my present three days before @CAPS1. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I planned to, I slowly tore the paper away and found a lovely velvet diary with golden boarders. Inside was a note: @CAPS7 only have you earned yourself a new diary, you now have the gift of patience. Now I understood.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11403	18641	7	I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while.	8	9		2				0.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11413	18651	7	I know a lot of patient people, and I have had many expierences that have to do with patience. My friend, @PERSON1, is usually impatient. Whenever she is waiting for something she texts me saying, @CAPS1! or, @CAPS2 onnn! @CAPS3 one day she was actually very patient. My family, @PERSON1, and I were going to the zoo one @DATE1 @TIME1. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We were going to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and @CAPS3 go to the zoo. But my mom slept in and she still had to take a shower! She said we would pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 am, and it was already @NUM2 am. We were running late and I thought @PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunatly, @PERSON1 wasnt mad! She was understanding and said that it was ok. Usually, she would say something like, @CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long? @CAPS5 time she didnt say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joy! I have had expieriences with many patient people and @CAPS5 expierience turned out to be fun!	12	9		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11414	18652	7	I think patience is all about waiting for something you want to happen or you dont want to happen. Sometimes it hits uninspected. Specaly at cedar point you need a lot of patience. Beep! Beep! I hit my alarm clock with all my force so I hope the thing would turn off. Butt @DATE1 I was going to cedar point and I count wait. So I got up took a shower and ate breakfast which was great my mom made blueberry mudines.  I got all of my close pack a week early because, I was so edsited. I put my clothes in the car and my brother, sister, mom, dads so we could get going quicker. The car ride wasnt so grate because, it was three hours long but we had a tv in our carso it didnt take as long as it normally does because, were occupied so it is like a shorter car ride for my brother sister and I. When we got into the howtell it was awesome because, it was like @NUM1 storys high. And we also had to use the elevator to get to our room ont @NUM2 floor. My sister was amazed by all of the stuffed animals and wainted to buy the furry things but she couldnt. My mom woke us up come on the rides open in about @NUM3 min we got be there. So I raced up out of bed running around like I got fire on my butt trying to find my clothes. So found all of my clothes and raced around to get my shoes on the others side of the bed. So by the time we were all up dressed and showered the rides have been going on for an hour so we walk over to the gate and got the one ride called million ofcare. The sigh said @NUM4 hours wait sorry the ride is know just to got started because of difficutys  with the seatbelts and others technical difuctlelys sorry. So my mom said wait here at ride it is realy fun. So was waited and waited I have no patience any more I will buy you a hot dog after this so I did and the ride was a blast @NUM1 hours at the park. Was fun but we had to go tomorow. And I got my hot dog.  That was my story of being patience at cedar point when all is you want to do was have fun. Sometimes you got to be patinced to get what you want.	11	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11415	18653	7	One hot @DATE1 day my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. There was a new ride open called shoot the rapids. It was a brown tall water ride with a tunnel and two hills. As we walked over to see how long the wait was it said @NUM1 hour wait. We all really wanted to go on it so we decided to wait. When we got in the line it was about @NUM2 outside, we were all sweating. And to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something. It was really annoying. We were about half way threw the line when my nerves kicked in I was really scared but I knew I had to be brave and suck it up. About @NUM3. Later we were @NUM4 people away from the ride. My heart was pounding, my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then all of a sudden it broke down. We had to wait another @NUM5. As time past we finally got on the water ride. I regret it. I screamed and cried but Im glad.  I didnt chicken out. That was a time I had patience and regret it.	12	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11418	18656	7	Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go throught it. Being the one who is patient usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and me and my two younger brothers couldnt wait to get to @LOCATION1. We got to the airport thinking we would get right on the airplane. But when we got there we found out we had to wait @NUM1  hours until the plane left and wed be on our way to @LOCATION1. So we decided to play our games we brought with us. We were being very patient. Finally it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot talk into speakers Im very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we @MONTH1 not proceed until it clears up. @CAPS1!? @CAPS2 long will it take? asked my mom. About five hours, she said. Its a good thing we brought our @CAPS3 player so that would hold us off for about two hours. For the rest of the time, played, slept, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we very patient for the whole five hours, even my three year old brother, she would reward us with five @ORGANIZATION1 world pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, no matter @CAPS2 hard it is you will maybe get rewarded just like my family.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11424	18662	7	A time that I was patient was when I took my first @CAPS1 test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy. I finished it with about one and a half hours left. For an hour and a half I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a @NUM1 year old, imagine @NUM2 minutes! At first I was fidgeting, then my neck started to hurt, so I layed my head down. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still. Soon enough the time flew by and the @CAPS2.E.A.P was over (done for the day). I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those @NUM2 minutes.	9	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

There was tons and tons of precidens under the tree. There was tiny ones all the way to hamuges ones. But I couldnt even peek at them because my mom and dad were still not up. I wanted to go into my moms and dads room and wake them up. But no without some brekfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so can open my precidens. After my mom and dad were done eating I finally got to open my precidents.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11426	18664	7	Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people @CAPS4t have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but heres a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like theres no tomorrow. To bad I couldnt play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience.. @CAPS1 ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face.  @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser , lions are winning and steelers are loosing he added. @CAPS4t get to happy , theres still plenty of time left. I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I d loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, who is the loser now, huh? wow all it took was patient, and hope I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little  competive but if you  just wait and tolerate whats happening around you, youll end up getting rewarded!.	10	9		3				2.0	3.0	3.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11429	18668	7	In sports you always have to be patient. Like if your not making any shots or someone is getting the best of you. If your patient and keep working hard sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player. @PERSON1 was very patient in his basketball career. At @PERSON2 high where he went to high school he wasnt the biggest, fastest, the strongest, or even the best, but he was patient. When he was a @CAPS1 in high school he frield out for the varsity, but didnt make it. He was so upset with himself and the coaches because he felt like he shouldve made the team. His mom went fo him and told him not to give up. Unlike most kids @PERSON1 didnt quit or tell himself that he wasnt good enough. He stayed patient and kept working hard. All that worked paid off because the next year he made the team. He went on to go @LOCATION1. He won a championship there with a game winning shot. He went on to get drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @CAPS3s were one of the worst teams in the @ORGANIZATION1. It took a couple years for @PERSON1 to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his first couple seasons @PERSON1 stayed calm and on to win five more championships. In his last one @PERSON1 was getting older and he knew he would be tested. They made it to the finals. The @CAPS2 were getting tired though. They went down in the series @NUM1. @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 kept pushing and kept fighting. Finally the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 was put in some tough situations, but he stayed patient and played like an all-star.	9	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11436	18676	7	I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see @LOCATION1 their was a @CAPS1 line. I was in the mall and from where @LOCATION1 was it went all the way to the street. It was @NUM1 and my bedtime is @NUM2 so I had to hurry up. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where me and our parents were. They saved us a spot in line. It was all ready @NUM3 after @NUM4 and the line didnt even move. I was so mad. Every @NUM5 the line would scoot to a bit. When I was about to leave the line just started going up like a boom-army. @CAPS2 when I started getting excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me a airsoft gun and a pony. The reason why is because I would ride the pony and shoot people who crossed my path. That would have been the life. @CAPS2 all I wanted to do. And I think @LOCATION1 would give me good airsoft gun because @DATE1 can come earlier than expected. As I was talking to my guys as were next is. We went to???.  I ask him what I wanted and he said youll shoot you eye out side. @CAPS2 when I got mad because it had to be so patient. That is the last time Im going to visit @LOCATION1 at the mall.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11438	18678	7	The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you dont ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you dont get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you dont get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you dont get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and dosnt pay you no mind and you still try to teach or show them something thats a sign of patients. Sometimes patients because, if you maybe want to have a job as a theropist you need a lot of patients. Those are some definitions of patients.	5	6		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a home to move to. Secondly I wasnt told when I could go home. I had to wait till everything was over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed and waited. I had to have patience with everyone. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to get home and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack to this day I am still unpacking. Being a foster takes a lot of patience.

11445	18686	7	There was a new restaurant opening in town! He really wanted to go so his family went. It had opened @NUM1 minutes ago. They didnt think there was going to be a line. They got there and they didnt see any cars in the drive thru. They went through the drive through which started at the back of the restaurant. Then they say about @NUM2 cars. He was really mad. They were about to leave and then there were @NUM3 cars behind them, so they stayed in line. Since it was a new restraunt everyone was picking their food very slowely. They where also making the food very slowely. Then people started yelling, @CAPS1 up, they where also honking their horns but he was the only who wasnt honking his horn. They where waiting for @NUM2 minutes and @NUM1 had gone @CAPS3. He was starving and he still was being very patient. He usually is not patient. He was very excited to eat at the new restraunt.  When it was his turn the cashier said, @CAPS2 you for being very patient. @CAPS3 the time they got their food it took @NUM6 hour. The food wasnt even good! He showed a lot of patience that day. He didnt honk his car horn and he wasnt yelling. He had stayed in the car @NUM6 hour and he was starving. It is a great thing to have patience.	9	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11447	18689	7	Patience is a very important virtue. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, itll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have.	4	4		1				0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11448	18690	7	I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is without patience you wouldn't be able to wait for anything. One example is you wouldn't be able to wait in line. My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday. One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it. Lastly patience is important because without patience wouldn't be able to read. This is because books sometimes take a while to read and you wouldn't want to take the time to finish it. That's exactly why l believe patience is important.	6	5		1				0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11449	18691	7	One time I went to a carnival with my dad. We had a blast while we were there. I kept on winning prizes at the games they had. I thought to myself nothing will get in my way well I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this one time I was tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival is saw this new ride. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I got in line I was ready to go on. Until, someone got infront of me. Thats when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited  as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour but, it was only @NUM1 minuets. People kept on going ahead of me. As if they did not see me, so did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude remark. As I was about to say the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, as it was my turn to go on I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything. When the ride was over I quickly went to my dad. I so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasnt so bad. Look like I can do something positive. If they thought was gonna get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they I was gonna say something.	10	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. Are you sure you dont want me to take him? I ask for the tooth time. @CAPS4, I got it! @CAPS7 says happily. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didnt have my arm being pulled off. Are you sure? I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. @CAPS5! @CAPS7 says lightly, I got it! @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day Ive been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. I think my hands are numb I say joining them into my pockets. @CAPS6, at least its not raining, like the weather man said, @CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back.

11452	18695	7	A time I was patient was when I had to baby sit little cousin. He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I coudn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else.	8	9		2				1.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11469	18713	7	I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didnt even know that means, but if Im patient Ill probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it.	8	4		2				0.0	3.0	3.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11471	18715	7	The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only suppose to be three ours long but one of cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited at a gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriatly for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all signs of kings that said @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said @CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1! We were finally there! We were excited and had the time of our lives!!! By: unica @CAPS2 .Amstrong	9	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11473	18717	7	Patience is a key role in life. If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just cant stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. Im around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen.	7	5		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I dont have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world dont have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I dont think if I didnt have any patients I wouldnt be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and dont have and they get bad grades and everything.	5	5		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11480	18724	7	so @CAPS1 do you want for your @DATE1? A @NUM1 @CAPS1 else do you want? A @NUM1 I have been wanting a play station @NUM3 for so long. Its my thirteenth @DATE1 and I never wanted something more. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house we played night and day. I wanted one I wanted one really dad. The only exception was that it cost @MONEY1 and I already had a @MONEY2 @DATE1 party, all together it would be a @MONEY3 @DATE1. So my mom and I decided on an agreement @CAPS3 I pay @MONEY4 then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I dont want any other presents, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate. I knew thats where I would get my @MONEY4. Everything seemed perfect I had it all planed out. Have the family party couple days after @DATE1 then go buy my @NUM1! I didnt mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. hey mom when are we having the family party? @DATE2. @CAPS2 that moment there was steam coming out of my ears, I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You @MONTH1 not realize it out @DATE2 is a whole month away from my @DATE1. @CAPS3 waiting @NUM5 days isnt patient then I dont know @CAPS1. From this day on I still havent gotten my @NUM1 but two days from now Ill be holding a stack of  cash in my hands and heading to gamertop: @CAPS3 I had to wait any longer I probably wouldnt have made it. Im not very patient.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11481	18725	7	A time I was patient was at my friend cousins birthday party. I was patient because the whole intire time that we were at the party I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friends parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited we colored a couple dinosaurs pictures, watched a movie, ate dinner, played in the basement, went in the garage and ate cake and icecream, decorated/painted our dance tool boxes, colored some more pictures, watch my friends cousin open his presents and much much more. Then it started getting dark outside so we tried to take a little map @CAPS1, it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon enough it was time for my friend to go and then my parents said that we could have a sleepover, @CAPS1 OF @CAPS2 my friends mom said not to night because my friend has a volley ball game in the @TIME1. It felt like I waited for nothing. Then I realized when your patient you get what you want more often.	9	11		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11482	18726	7	Being patient is important, as Ive learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldnt get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1s house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friends birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldnt fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards.	12	8		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11483	18727	7	Patience @CAPS1 is being polite by waiting for someone or something. It is polite to be patient, if your not patient that means you are just about practicly mean because you are judging someone or makeing them do something really fast. For example if you are waiting inline for a ride at a comiville or something then if you are patient your being nice to other people by not trying to hurry or something like that. If you. are impatient and you are standing in line you would be mean to other people by like saying hurry up I want to be on that ride or hurry up and start the ride allready. There is the example. If you are a patient person people will probly like you. If you are impatient then you will probly have a hard time getting along with somebody.	5	4		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	2.0	1.0	1.0									"Write about patience.

I was always done early, so I couldnt go on to the next part. Also we couldnt talk or get out of sets. I really wanted to go on t the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Every one in the class got done early to sense we couldnt talk we just sat and weighed for testing time to be over I think every one wanted to go to the next part but we didnt no body complained or said anything we had to do this for a few day every year.

We sat down she was about to say something so I took a deep breath, you have to be patient and no complaining. I nodded my head with a smile so big with looked like my lips were about to fall off. @NUM4 A few weeks later. I got a little better every day. Her name was @PERSON4. She was very nice and thoughtful. She told me I was progressing by waiting and seeing the results. Finally the hundred points there came. I was nervous but confident at the same time. That test is going in wish it he met me! A week later @PERSON1 passed @PERSON6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 and @PERSON7. A smile on her face good job @PERSON5 you got an A-. It was hard in the begging but I was patient and I got a good grade. @NUM5 wait and donât hag and see the results of the end. Patience helped me because I know in the future to be tolerant.

11495	18741	7	Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I cant tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didnt mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, @ORGANIZATION1 raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether its a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1s uncles patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient.	11	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

Then I had to wait what felt like weeks was @NUM1 days (@NUM2 week). I was counting down the days. That just made it feel longer. So I desided to tell my self I didnt want it so I wasnt anxious to get it. That kind of worked.

11506	18753	7	In my opinion, I am a very inpatient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something , theyd better stop it on the spot or @PERSON1 I rate, child makes a huge breakthrough, also, I am not one of those kids who waits for dinner, I snack my way to it! and when I am at school, I just @CAPS1 listening to meap instructions for hours on end. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy.! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape or form. If we make one noise, he immediately goes on a rampage!

11507	18754	7	Patience is a very good thing that I and a lot of people lack. One person that does not lack patience is the head coach of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION4 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been very patient for the past couple years. He did not try to make his team be better than they were he just had them try their @CAPS2 and see what the end result was. The @ORGANIZATION4 ended up going @NUM1 that year and by getting the second worst record in the national @ORGANIZATION3 they got the second pick in the twenty tend @ORGANIZATION6 draft. In that draft the @ORGANIZATION4 took @ORGANIZATION5 an defensive lineman out of the @ORGANIZATION2. He is an outstanding player and the @ORGANIZATION4 other pick was a fast running back named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 out of the @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1's team is so good this year because of @PERSON1's patience with his team and his understanding of his player's talents.	6	12		2				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11508	18756	7	Who likes being patient its so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know its good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but theyre lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldnt wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didnt complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you cant do it just be patient and it will pay off.	11	10		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11517	18765	7	Have you ever had enough patients to deal with @NUM1 screaming  kids. I,can proudly say that i can. It all started when my uncle steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed alot of help so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to @LOCATION1 to help them. The only problem was there where @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 has an expedition car so all @NUM2 of us could fit. But,it didnt take long  for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smocshed in and get really hot. So all of the @NUM1 kids start fighting. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 got real stressed real fast. I thank god that there was atleast a @CAPS5.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn@CAPS5 get to watch it. After about @NUM1 hours Id had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. By now we had been driving about @NUM7 hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then @CAPS6. Everybody screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally after about @NUM8 hours we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9. It was @NUM10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patients I had. After that I dont think that I want to go on a roadtrip again.	8	10		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11523	18771	7	Patience is probably one of the hardest things to do in the world. One time I remember when I was patient was when my family and I went to @CAPS1 point. When we went to @CAPS1 point we all were ready to ride the magnum, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we were planning on riding that first. We got in line after a little while we had to wait for the rain to stop the wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided that I would be a little more patient and not complain. Although, not being able to sit down after a while gets kind of painful but I still never complained. A little while later I actually started forgetting I was in line because the people started letting more of us on. I guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn how to be a little more patient with people because of how good every thing worked out intil we got to the bumper cars.	12	9		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11525	18773	7	Being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait. @CAPS1s a good one to have too, @CAPS1 can help you in a lot of situations. If gas have patience, you wont get nervous or anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend @PERSON1 was getting me. I didnt think about @CAPS1 that much so @CAPS1 didnt really get to me. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be really cool, which made being patient a little bit harder. I was still able to keep @CAPS1 off my mind. I had to make sure I didnt think about @CAPS1, so I wouldnt beg my friend to know what @CAPS1 was, because that would be impatient. If your impatient people might get annoyed because you will always ask questions, and got on there nerves. @CAPS1s good to be patient with friendhips, so you dont become mean to them or anyone else. @CAPS1s @CAPS2 not good to be impatient with your family. If your patient you can work things out better, and stay more on task and focused.	6	8		2				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11527	18775	7	Heres a story about time when I was patient. So the story begins at art prize and loved to see the beautiful art there, but I was dieing to see the winnig picture for art prize. My parent told me to wait until we all see the rest of the art prize amazing art. So I signed and replyed ok we can see the rest of the art prize things first.  While we were looking at the art the whole time I was thinking about the winning piece. That is all I thought about. ??? A little bit later. I was thinking of what a blessing it is to be here at art prize. So I checied up and disieded patience is good. And if you wait for something for a while it all of a sodden it seems more valuable.  A couple hours later I started to head to the car, and my mom intrupted and said, @CAPS1 dont you want to see the winning piece of art? @CAPS2 yes I forget.@CAPS3 there is not a line now so when we go to see it there was no line. I was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It was a picture of sergeants drawn out of just a pencil. That day I learned that patient is important, because that way it was worth the wait to see something that you like.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I replied saying that my parent are out, theyll be back in a few hours, Ill ask later. @CAPS6 finally around @NUM2 pm my parents came home and I asked about the sleepover. She said, I dont know. And walked away. About a hour later I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @CAPS1 and said that I could. She replied finally! @CAPS4 I had to go pack. @CAPS6 I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, @CAPS5! I need you to take the dogs out before you leave! @CAPS6 I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to @CAPS7 house she opened the door and let me in. I said, @CAPS8 it took @CAPS6 long.

11531	18779	7	Yo! Im the narrator you know the dude that tells the story, well Im gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is @CAPS1. Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1 being the smart @CAPS1 he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. @CAPS1 went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. @CAPS1 was no longer made fun of. @CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell!	10	8		2				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11532	18780	7	Being patient is a very difficult thing to do. Many people cant be patient. For example my brother. If he orders something online or is wait for dinner be perparred he always has to be winey of when hes going to get what he wants. Im not like that. I actully have patience. For example I needed shoes so I searched the internet to see if I could get a good deal. I was searching on the @ORGANIZATION1 store when I saw these really good shoes. I asked my dad if I could order them online. So the next day my mom orders them online, I was so excited, I waited and waited. After three day I missed my school bus. My mom had to go to college and she couldnt drop me off. So I stayed home alone. I found out that my dad was comeing home that exact day and the house was a mess. So I started cleaning. My mom came home and saw a box laying on the front. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there! I went to go welcome her and I saw my shoes lay there. I jumped up in excitement and put them on and it was a perfect fit. My mom came in the room and said they were suppose to arrive on @DATE1 but since you were patient they came early.	7	8		2				2.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting @CAPS6 their turn of departure on the ??? I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the ??? as I searched @CAPS6 room @NUM1. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up @CAPS1 magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did @NUM2 minutes ago, @CAPS2 how much longer? The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, not much longer now dear. @CAPS3, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I roll my eyes, but cant help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as @CAPS5 texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock @CAPS5 scowls and continues. Just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. Across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope. @PERSON1  the doctor is ready to see you now. @CAPS4, I avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door. You know its funny, @CAPS5 says well snapping her gum. @CAPS6 someone. So young you were the most patient person out there! I merely nod my head and grin because I understand that patient people, experience difficulties without complaining and I am very grateful that Im a patient person.  stand in the	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11543	18791	7	To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding,and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This @DATE1, I went to my cousins house to watch her daughter @CAPS1 @PERSON1 , for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldnt wait.When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping , and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing , and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldnt hush. Tthen I said,  @NUM1 , whats the matter ? @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because  I stayed somewhat calm and I didnt complain to @CAPS1@CAPS4s mom.	11	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11552	18800	7	One time when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I had to wate about @NUM1 hours to go on the top thrill dragster. I was so patient because it was my first time ever going on the dragster. Me and my dad were wating and wating. When we got to the front of the line I was so scared that I was going to pee my pants. When we got on the rollercoaster I said that I dont want to go. So my dad asked if my son could get off the rollercoaster and they said when you get on there is no getting off. So I had to ride it and when I did I wanted to go on it over and over again. Even though it was a @NUM2 second ride it was the best thing that I had ever wated for in my life so far. That is the time when I had to be patient to get something that I really wanted.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11556	18804	7	Being patience is a good thing because if you are and then you are in some rough time in life. Patience people can do by bringing something to do. They could what there for three hours and not be herd. There are some people that cant what there for three hours. There are some people that cant what there for ten minets. These people get made at that and they will just give up. But after all of those people that can and cant people cant quit. People what there for one hour and will blow up. And then there are people that cant do it but they do. So all you have to do is find anything to do if you cant do it.	5	4		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11566	18814	7	What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tryed everything for four years, begging, pleading, even cleaning, but it still didnt work. My mom says I have to be @NUM1 before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her, I sat back and stayed patient. By doing that, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until soccer is finished and find a place and shell take me. Patience really helps in many different ways and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place.	9	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11567	18815	7	Sometimes being patient is hard @CAPS5 Ive had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. Ive always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early to see @CAPS3 my presents @CAPS5 their were none. My mom was just watching @CAPS1.V. like nothing was important and I said to her, @CAPS2. @CAPS3 she said back was @CAPS2, why are you up this early? I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, @CAPS5 nothing. Eventually I went downstairs and played video games until @NUM1, just waiting for someone to say happy birthday @CAPS5 yet, nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until @NUM2: pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient I got a good party and now Im patient every day.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

The part that sticks out the most is seeing my favorite christan rock band, @CAPS2. They played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos. I bought one of their cd's and it was amazing. The past that made me patient was the line that my friend @PERSON1 and I had to wait in to get autographs. It almost streched out the gate into the parking lot. The bad part was we were pretty much at the end of it. Even though the wait was long the girl behind us was super nice so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front the wait was all worth it. All of the band members were super nice and I gave there lead singer @CAPS3 my lucky braclet. That was the time I was patient.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11570	18818	7	My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been dying for was actually mine. I was going to see three days @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled.  I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums.  Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left.  The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in . I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11577	18825	7	Everyone is patient one time in their life. I remember I was every patient one day when I was ten year old. It was all because of popcorn. A small little popcorn cernal cought in my throught .That was an aginizing day, but I was very patient. One day, about two year ago when I was ten years old swallowed a popcorn cernal after going to a movie. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box then trowing the box away. Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion we all learnt to be patient sometimes. I was patient to get home and drink some water. I am always patient and when it pays off I am always happy.	10	11		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11578	18826	7	There have only been a few times in my life where I really had to be patient, but the I can remember the most was when I was at the @LOCATION1 airport. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal, for our flight to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2d been waiting about @NUM1 minutes when @CAPS2 heard an announcement. @CAPS1 has gone wrong with the plane but @CAPS5 should be fixed in about an hour. @CAPS2 eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay. But @CAPS6 there was another announcement Im sorry, but @CAPS2 cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of @NUM2 hours. @CAPS3 sounded worse, but I kept calm. My mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed. @CAPS6 four. @CAPS6 @CAPS4. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power so I was just fiddling with my fingers. @CAPS6 @CAPS2 heard @CAPS5 turns out @CAPS2 cannot get the part until tomorrow morning. @CAPS6 a big ughhh swept accrcoss the terminal. But luckily, @CAPS2 received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but @CAPS2 all had patience, so @CAPS2 got through @CAPS5.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11579	18827	7	A couple of days ago when I was at cheer a lot of drama was going around our team, it was fifteen days befor compition and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom cutine in our second formation wasnt in a diagnal line we were supposed to be and wasnt getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us so we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1(one of our coaches daughters) was yelling at the side Im on for not getting to the kickline in time even though shes the on pushing us father down so we cant get there then she started yelling at @PERSON1 saying it was all her falt so then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 stop blaming everyone else for everything you arnt perfect at everything ether, and your  the ones pushing us over so we cant get to the kickline in time. @LOCATION1 didnt know what to say but she said @CAPS1 up @PERSON2! that isnt true. even though you could tell that she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline she didnt move closer to the center she moved farther and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1 even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends, they still are friends, just not best friends.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11586	18835	7	One day, last year I had to be really patient my mom had told the family that we would be going to six flags soon. I was filled with excitement and I couldnt wait so I asked her when and she said she didnt know yet. This made me upset because last time she said that about going somewhere, we ended up not going. The only thing that I knew for sure was that it had to be on a @DATE1 because she works during the week I was just happy that school was finally out so I didnt have to worry about home-work. So I waited until @DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go that @DATE1. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldnt randomly go one @DATE1. That @DATE1 I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure. She didnt have any meetings or projects for the coming @DATE1. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free @DATE1 she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because thats better than nothing .Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for six flags. When the two weeks were finally over I had about @MONEY1 saved up and I was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I have ever been.	12	10		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

When I was at an outdoor mail with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! After ward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise!

11601	18853	7	Patience @MONTH1 seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if its a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldnt believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dads dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, will you use it?	11	12		3				2.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11603	18855	7	The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride shoot the @CAPS1 at @CAPS2 point. Frist @CAPS2 point was fun but waiting in line took patients we had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was to long of a wait. I had to stay patient if i wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was exited to ride the rollar coster so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting but it was worth it when i got to ride. As you can see sometimes its good to stay patient but when you get to do something fun its worth it.When people push you just had to stay calm and be patient.	8	6		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11605	18857	7	Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when its the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasnt back yet I didnt know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didnt belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. @CAPS3! I shouted, I dont have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  @NUM1 minets till midnight @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me Thats impossible I told her. You can make it. @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasnt that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. @CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen how is it going to end @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. @CAPS9 was that wait really that bad @CAPS10 asked. I guess not I answerd sheepishly. Being patient payed off @CAPS10 lectured. I didnt reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that Im a little better at being patient things will be a lot better.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

She is a very patient and pleasant girl. @CAPS1 is so patient that when I told her to hold on for a second, there I came back an hour later and she was still there she is absolutely the most patient and the most awesome girl I know! On test(like @CAPS3.E.A.P) she always takes her time. And she uses her time wisely (ha ha and her last name is @CAPS2). At the @ORGANIZATION1 she doesnt await in a long line for a corn dog.Now I@CAPS3 starting to think that @CAPS1 enjoys waiting. I love having @CAPS1 around because she doesnt mind to wait for me when I have to do something.	7	7		2				1.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

Backstage was cold and crouded and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital and I thought the whole thing would take an hour, I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform and it was at least five hours long. @CAPS1 many more dances? and what dance are we on? @CAPS2 what everyone had on there mind or was saying.

When I got off the field I got my water bottle and sat on the subed in until finally I asked my coach if a could go in. his response was you just got off. In my mind I was thinking that I had been off for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just come off. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally put me in. when I got on the field realized I was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game. I played for around five minutes then got subed again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patients. I asked my coach if I could go back in, he said sure. When the game was over I realized why my coach benched me so much of the game because he likes @LOCATION1 wolverines and I was wearing a state tattoo on my face.

11624	18879	7	You @MONTH1 have heard before: patience is a virtue. If you dont know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. The opposite of this probably having a temper, or having a @CAPS1 short time before you get @CAPS1 angry. I believe having patience in life is @CAPS1 important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots I related life to sports, because I am a @CAPS1 good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my reciever drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether youre a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, @CAPS2, dont do it again. @CAPS3 that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and dont make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concitrate on winning next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtue a person can have.	9	8		2				0.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

Patience has Patience is a @NUM1 year old girl who is always told how patient she @CAPS1 is one of many stories about patience being very patient. One day patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in juancey so her mom started to look it up on the internet. It take her mom two weeks to get every thing ready, she had the amusment park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they are going to stay at @TIME1. The whole time patience said nothing and just waited without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her an amusment park. When they got to the hotel Patience mom had to get the room key get to their room unpack and get dressed to go. The whole patience didn't say anything. When they finally got to the amusement park there was a looong line to get tickets so they had to wait for two hours. The whole time patience did not complain. They finally got their ticket and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. But there was a looong line for that to, Patience told her mom she really wants to go on this ride and wants to wait in line. Her mom said ''ok '' and they waited for an hour until they get to go on it, but all the waiting was worth it. Patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had fun. That is patience story of being patient. I hope you liked it.	8	10		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11627	18882	7	That's gotta hurt! every buy to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang. After it got all better my football coach said that I will only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the @DATE1 he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game.	8	6		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	1.0	1.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. @CAPS1 last serve I thought, please be over. I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didnt make @CAPS3 over. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1 stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervos by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3. I felt a ruch of relief and excitment when I saw the sight of the word congradulations. @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, you have made the @CAPS2 team. I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didnt. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not. I wouldnt of had @CAPS3 any other way.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

Like if your waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of thing an your in a bit of a rush. Now yo could be rude and yell, him or her scream and all that crazy mess or you could wait patient and maybe she will let you cut.

11637	18892	7	Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesnt understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesnt get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you.	8	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven oclock, he will be there by seven oclock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven oclock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way.

11648	18904	7	Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you dont have the time to do something then you dont have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldnt be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldnt be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9. @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now	8	6		2				1.0	1.0	3.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

It was a pitching barn. @PERSON3 trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn, and I had turned on the heater. I was warming up, doing wrist flicks, 'k-s', one leg throw, arm circles, and screw ball flicks. My catcher, @PERSON1, caught the ball everytime. @PERSON3 said, @CAPS1. Let me see your screwball and rise ball."" I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It curved right and the glove cracked."" ""@CAPS2! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!"" @PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand and we both said ""@CAPS3!"" ""@CAPS4, @CAPS4 good. Now throw me a rise,"" @PERSON2 said. I threw one. @PERSON3 gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls."" You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more,"" he said. He never lost patient with me. Not ever after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches I had finally got it.

11654	18910	7	On a super hot summers day, me, my mother and @CAPS1 all went to best western. The reason is that we dont have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, ok, everyone back in the pool. I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasnt worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time ill try to be less agervated and more happy, maybe.	8	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting. Then @NUM1 later we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menus and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finnaly after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasnt frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again.	8	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11667	18924	7	I think patience comes into role in a lot of places. For example you have to be patient to get a job or else the boss will kick you right out of the building without saying one word to you. Another place you would have to be patient to be successful. If you moan and groan because something is taking too long to happen, thats not patience. The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it. Lastly if you have to wait for it not get it right away, if you money from your job you dont just go rob the place you have to be patient and you have to wait.	6	4		1				0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	1.0									"Write about patience.

11684	18941	7	Im going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now dont get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, touh, I think its to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I dont know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! Its very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I cant help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a sniff, sniff, sniff sniff, snot. Were not aloud to get up, so were stuck sniff, sniff, snot-ing  all hour long. When you were a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, its none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, thats better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably dont have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this writing about patience, but now, Im done.

11685	18942	7	One time when I had a lot of paitenits is when I sprined my one ice skating. I was doing spins and trichs everywhere, and one I did not land. I fell on my back, but the bone I hurt was my arm, my mom was surprised that I could even stand up because of how hard I fell. My arm was hurting so bad from it. So my mom rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning it was hurting @NUM1 times more. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays for it, and they took two weeks to devnlop. So I was in two weeks of pain. So it turns out that I didnt break my arm, however I was in a lot of pain waiting for the resualts. It took a lot of paients for me to just wait, and, wait, and wait for those x-rays,	10	10		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11688	18945	7	Patience is a virtue. I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. patience is virtue, patience is a virtue. I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. Shes an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I dont love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, Ive dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasnt too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didnt have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. @PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now. @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didnt want poop all over the house. I know, but I cant well why cant you? @CAPS1 I dont want to. I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying patcience is a virtue. I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. @PERSON4 Ill bet you cant go get them as fast as a cheetah! @CAPS2 I can! @CAPS3, prove it. @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I was currently in first place .I was nervous .I was nervous because if I win I will get two tickets to @LOCATION1s @CAPS3. I sat quietly in a chair. I tried not to show that I was nervous. All I could do was wait for it to end. Then, my mom said we could wait by riding rides at the fair. First, I went on the tilt I whirl. I was wondering if anybody beat my score during the whole ride. Next, we looked for another ride. I was trying not to think about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got of my mom told me that I won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize. When I was waiting it was scary, but it was worth it. I was nervous the whole time. I tried not to think of it too. I was very anxious I want to do it again some time. I told you when I was patient. When were you?	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. @CAPS1s in the drawer! Now get out of my room, she yelled.

I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting payed off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house.They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pigs.

11700	18959	7	A time when I was pacient is when Im at gymnastics. When you are trying to learn a new skill pacients is the key. For example when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to hand stand it was difficult. Day after, day I never could do it. I put my personl best ever day but I had to be pacient my coach said. He said when the day comes youll do it but until then you need to keep trying and do the best you can do. It could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill but I just have to wait until the day my body will do the skill he said. So I waited and waited. Tried and tried but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally after four months of doing this I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day my coach told me I told you that you could do it it just takes time and patience but today was your day and you did it. This is a time I had to use patcience to get my new skill. I learned being pacient is hard and all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you.	9	12		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results were very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. @CAPS3s wrong! @CAPS11 her mom. @CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out.

Take you, for example, your being very impatient. @CAPS6 Im waiting said @CAPS7 @CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot. The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. @CAPS9 said @PERSON2. @CAPS3s this? @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 @CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read. @CAPS13 you said @LOCATION1.

11705	18964	7	A long wait   @CAPS1 only four at the time. I had moved to @LOCATION4. Yes, moved to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4 from @LOCATION1, @CAPS2. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didnt care too, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I wasnt four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didnt hate the idea but I didnt love it either. Of course. It didnt exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didnt want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. Ive slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficult has been that I dont get to see everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now Ill get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I cant wait! For years of waiting has provided me with an opportunity !	12	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

It was a warm @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was at my sisters house playing  wii with my niece, when my brother in law matt comes into the living room and says, @CAPS1 bored, lets do something today! @CAPS2 we all decided that we would go to michigans adventures for the day. My sister @PERSON1 told us to pack the coler with snacks and drinks and to put pillows and blankets in the back seat of the car. But little did we know that we were actually having six hours to @CAPS3 to go to six flags and that @PERSON1, matt and my mom have been planning this for weeks. After being in the car for two hours i moaned are we there yet? no. said @PERSON1 were lost oh  I replyed. But I really didnt think about how were lost because weve been to michigans adventures a thosand times before. For the rest of ride there i was pretty quiet. In other words @CAPS4 was very asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me with excitment. I stretched and squinted from the suns  raise when my eye adjusted to the light I looked around and realised that we were at six flags! When we got in the first ride we rode was the supeman on that ride you sit and things lock around your legs and stomache and i tilts you over @CAPS2 its like your flying we wanted to ride it @CAPS2 bad but the line was @NUM1 ½ hours long. While we were standing in line we found things to do like swing and play on the metal railing, play I spy and all sorts of things and when we finally were on and off the ride I realized that it was really fun, and worth it and that i was patient and didnt complain.	11	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11713	18973	7	Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.	6	6		2				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

Then while your testing, there is someone who can sit still and their desk starts rattleing.

11717	18978	7	I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like shes about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says theyre all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew Id do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 kids and a war. I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. Its too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled, @CAPS1 @PERSON1, thats not nice, please stop. @CAPS2 stops for about @NUM2 way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about @CAPS3 when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, when we finish learning the alphabet A-@CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!: I realized tothem thats like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldnt believe my ears. Every kid learned A-@CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept!	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I though about it for about a week begging my mom to tell me @CAPS1 I was getting. The days past and it fell like they got even longer and longer. I tried and tried day and day to try and take a peak at @CAPS1 I was getting, but I always got caught. So finally my mom told me to just stop thinking about it and be patient and it would name faster. So I waited, it seemed like it was takeing forever. The next day I woke up my brother came and jumped on me and said ah-ah I know @CAPS1 your getting and you dont. And I jumped up and said @CAPS1! How come you know and I dont? Thats bad tell me please And he said no then I got up and walked out the room and went to my mom and said I give up she looked and said just be patient and it will go by faster you only have four days left. then I walked away.

We played songs and had tests to everyone we were playing right. But on my tests, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON> noticed something funny on my tests. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me I needed a long  private lesson if I wanted to play my notes right. So one afternoon after school. I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then <@NUM2</PERSON> broke down the notes for us one by one. He told me  the correct way to play the notes. He had me play the notes again and again and together. When I messed up, he showed me how to play them being ?? patient with me. Then  finally I was playing every note .The lesson was about @NUM4 minutes and he was patient the entire process. Now i play my notes right thats to the lesson and @PERSON1s patience. Now I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can count on <@NUM2</PERSON>s patience to come out or there is ?? required classes.	11	8		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11741	19003	7	This year I tried out for the @NUM1  grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For bragging rigts,we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didnt play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like its the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadnt played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, can you do it?I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!	10	12		3				3.0	2.0	3.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill its over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesnt rush us unless were late.

Rec soccer was fun, but my two best friends and me were doing all the work no one else on the team were not doing anything. So I decide to go try out for a select team. A select team is in the second highest division you can be in. When try outs came I was really nervous. After I tryed out for three days, if you were selected you would get a phone call saying you made the team. It took long time to get a phone call it felt like it took a country. In between those days I had to wait and wait and wait and wait and so on, when you wait for a long period of time thats called patience.	8	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11751	19013	7	I think patient is when some one is able to wait and not complain. I was never patient, so here is a story I have made up. One day there was a girl named @CAPS1. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework., chores, take care of her sister and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because are she had was a math work shect ?? @NUM1 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were ?? addition and subtracts. That took her @NUM2 minutes, (@NUM3 on each side) which isnt that bad. Next she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister toys here all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that shes resting and not making man of mess, @CAPS2 took @CAPS1 about @NUM4 minutes to clean up all the days because all she bad to do was throw them back into the toy bar. Now , we go to her room. Ally messy room you first couldnt open the door. So she had to tog on the door until she could finally fit her self in. The door slammer shut from all the clothes but luckily didnt wake up her sister. @CAPS1 first made a check list of what she needed to do she had to: vacuum, fix her bed , and put all the food away that were in her room back in the kitchen. That took about @NUM5 hour and a half. So in all thats been about @NUM5:45 minutes. Now all she had to do clean up the rest of the dinner.  Her mom couldnt because she had to drop off her dad at the air part for work, so @CAPS2 was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had speghettl for dinner and her sister spilled the house all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took @NUM7 minutes, mopped which took like @NUM4 minutes, when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time.	9	7		2				1.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

Some times we have  to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game  and movie releases. but I am  going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasent waiting for the plane to arive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could but my grandma didnt like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just  to get our food. It was very crouded and it took all patience to not get angry at all the other people. Some examples of how i was feeling oxbout  my patients is picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patients  and stay calm.	6	9		2				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

Well you get the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the @DATE1, I was at my @CAPS1 saftey course put on by the @ORGANIZATION1. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success, or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of peoples' names who passed and their certificates. By the way everyone is outside wating. The first group was done @NUM1 minutes. It took about @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely were off, I just started rocking back and forth back and forth @CAPS2 my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a @CAPS3 better since @CAPS2. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I 've shot is partridge, and one @NUM3 point buck. That is my story, have a good night!	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11762	19028	7	Patience is a good thing  to have. Good things come from patience and bad things dont happen. But what is patience? Patience is being ablle to handle problems without whining and complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait while others cant. Some people are very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so he had  been saving up his extra money for a new @CAPS1. Once he had enough he got a new @NUM1 flat screen @CAPS1,but if he had waited only about another week he couldve gotten one about a foot bigger for the same price. Lets say your little sister is bagging you and you beep nicely asking her to stop but she just wont. So instead of totally flipping out on her which will get u into  tons of trouble just wait for a parent to get home so she gets in trouble and you dont	7	7		2				1.0	1.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11765	19031	7	One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said @CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @CAPS2 or later? I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didnt seem like much. When we got into the store thats when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said @CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients? Ill try. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said @CAPS4 you for your patients. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said Do you see what happens if you be patient? I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient.	10	11		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

You always have to be patient, weather or not if it is at school, an ammusinent park rides line in front, and behind a bunch of people, you will want to be patient, because if you are are not, you wouldnt want to lose it in front of all of those people and cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all those people, then, you would be emborresed. This is why I think patience is important.	6	4		1				0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11768	19034	7	Fishing is a great sports, but it takes a lot patience. My first fishing trip was at a lake about @NUM1 miles from my home. I had loved fishing ever since then, but the trip wasnt easy. I think that fishing is fun because I was patient accomplishing what I did took every oune of patience I had. When my uncle visits from @LOCATION1 he always brings his fishing rods and fishes in a differently. I never went with him until about one year ago. He decided that  I should bring a friend. So if I get boared, I would someone to talk to.The patience started when we were about half way there and @CAPS1 ! We hit a fence. The car had broken down so we called a land break.The wait was about @NUM2 hours, @NUM3 min and my friend asked. So are and my friend sucked .We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way .Once we got there, we had two problem to fix, and we had no bait. We found a nice spot at the other side of the lake. We had to sea venge for some baits, which took about @NUM4 hours for enough baits.We were finally ready to fish. We got the rods, sat the chairs, cast, and waited.There was no way to make fishing faster so we sat, hoping for some bites. In the end my uncle, my friend ,and I caught @NUM5 fish ! We had eat three for lunch and went home with @NUM6 fish left. I love to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could have happened but we went fishing , relaxed, and brough a couple of meals. Thats why I have fishing because it requires patience.	10	10		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

There is always a problem and my problem is I like to try and figure out what my present is. That is what stinks about being patient you are always waiting for something good to happen. All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily and if they dont wrap it very good I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are yelling not to leave them unpackaged.

11776	19044	7	Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time thats a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness thats a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you dont have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldnt complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.	4	3		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	1.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	1.0									"Write about patience.

11780	19049	7	During the @DATE1 my family and I went to @LOCATION3 for a couple weeks. In the beginning of the second week I did something i have never done before. My two older sisters (@LOCATION1 and @PERSON1), dad,cousin (@PERSON2), @PERSON2s uncle (@CAPS1) and I were on our way to the boat. I was excited, this was my first time fishing in a ocean. A few hours past and we didnt catch anything,but we still waited while drinking coffe, telling  jokes, doing little  pranks like pulling  each others line to make them think we caught something. We left at @NUM1 am and now it was @NUM2 pm. We still didnt catch anything but dad and @CAPS1 go fishing all the time and said we just had to be patient. About @NUM3 minutes later @CAPS3 line started pulling @CAPS1 helps her reach it in, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else. Now it was @NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. @PERSON2 was happy. Everyone was just being patient and waiting to catch something but @PERSON2 was also very patient because she had to use the bathroom for most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us on the boat had to secretly use the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home  we told evryone what we caught,which was nothing for everyone besides for @PERSON3 and her tiny clam. I know lots of people who wouldnt last on that boat for an hour. So i was proud of how patient everyone was and i hope to do it again next time i go to @LOCATION2 with my family.	12	10		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

Having patience is very important because if you have a gon??? and your not patient maugio wait  your turn here not going to hire you, here not looking for an impatient person. First, my family and I were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 but we had to leave at @DATE1 am so I couldnt go to sleep. I woke up at @TIME1am so I was tired. I couldnt take a nap because if I did the nap will turn into a deep sleep. Next I and to finish packing ?????????? so I  was really tired and  ?????????? show I was ran because it was  a hour left. When I was done packing. I started to watch t.v to keep me awake because I cant go to sleep under a ????????. Then   my cousin  had to have his diper changed so I was to change it, but @CAPS1 when I was @CAPS1 about to get ????????????????? called at and said lets go. I was happy because now I get to go to sleep in the rental van.  In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when your really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What really was about to make me angry was that I had to change a diper but some how I maintained my patience.	8	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

You ask your parents, when and they say, soon just have some patience! well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. aww! everyone screamed. @CAPS1 I hold her, and shes my dog, and lets name her also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. you are being so patient, you @CAPS1 be the one to hold her first! I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient @CAPS1 pay off!	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11791	19061	7	This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something   gets you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, youll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you cant, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you dont hurt their feelings if they cant do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both dont get in trouble. If you wouldnt have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience. Without patience you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. Thats why you need patience.	8	7		2				0.0	2.0	3.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11792	19062	7	I have a lot of patience for example one I really wanted to know @CAPS1 I made volleyball team, and I had patience, I did not complain. I believe having patience is very respectful toward yourself and others. Once I had a test and really wanted to know when we were going to receive it, but I had patience. Others did not have Patience they kept asking what we are going to get @CAPS1 both were complaining they did not have Patience. Another example is were going to go to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 and we still had planned the day I did not have ruler here that time, and it made it worse leaving the patience the more thinking about it and that made it work .Men @CAPS1 sometimes more  on and patient and sometimes not so much	9	6		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11796	19068	7	Lots of people are good at being patient Im not so good at it. But when your traveling along distance, you have to learn how to be patient. Several times a year, my mom, my sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive up to my @LOCATION2s house. She lives about @NUM1 hours away, near @LOCATION1. My @LOCATION2 loves when family visits, so we dont mind taking one weekend every few months to go and see her. Ive had to have been there at least @NUM2 times in my life time. My mom works the night shift at a well known hardware store. Usually, she works @NUM3 @CAPS1 to @NUM4 @CAPS2. So when she gets off work we would pack up and leave. I always bring my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drank lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 and started acting like an idiot, singing along to the songs. Until, my @CAPS3 died. I felt my heart break a little. I couldnt fall asleep now. I was still hyper. I started listening to the radio, but all we could listen to was country. Since, we were going @CAPS7, we were traveling away from the control tower of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached, The up @CAPS7 store where we always stop to get gas and food when we go to @LOCATION2s. I got @CAPS8 and even more pop. I gave a tiny evil laugh to myself as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, I finished my food and was bored once again. There was nothing to do in that car. I was angry at that point. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon enough, I had fallen asleep. I woke up to the sound of us pulling into the drive way, and my @LOCATION2 running to come greet us. Finally, we were there. I had survived yet another, ride to @LOCATION2s house. Then I remembered, we had to drive home too. Even though I make this trip several times a year, Im almost positive will never stop getting bored during the ride. Being patient, is not one of my favorite things to do.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

My gymnastics coach has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, he is like a brother to me. His name is @LOCATION1, I have known him since third grade. Whenever he sees me he says my baby! and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesnt. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. @CAPS1 I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic try again, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didnt stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1.	10	12		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

My mom wants say had on a couple of seconds and I would say @NUM1. But when I got older I was more patient. Like, I was patient with teachers and peers and parents but there are times that I still have a unpatient side, I will try not to get unpatient but sometimes it juss happens. I love having someone to talk to but some times I cant talk to them because Im unpatient. My friends are really good about it first though some time they dont my mom is really patient but my dad is not so maybe get it from him I dont really talk to my dad though although Im unpatient Im really out going and funny. I have a lot of friends because Im outgoing sometimes I get in trouble because Im outgoing and that has a blown side. I love talking and having fun maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun. I working on my patience. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing and maybe if I get more patient I will get better in school but I know I will try my hardest in the patience defortment.

I think this because she was born in the dimension she had to be patient for food, money, and water. She couldnt just go out and buy food at the grocer store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells then put them into a pan then start a fire and who knows how long that could take. Then finally wait for the shells to pop. That is war hinder then putting a bag in the mircowave and pushing a button. That is how she is also fooled with ??? even with me.

11814	19089	7	Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with if you are impatient, and then people will say that you are impatient, and needs to calm down. Being patient also means that you are polite person and that you will not complain about anything, also that whatever happens, you will be understanding and you will wait. Let`s say somebody was in a line to get food. You would have to wait your turn in order to get your food while the other person is getting his/her food. That is being an understanding and polite person and sometimes even a role model for litter children/ kids. You are setting an example and being considerate. These are many reasons on why being patient takes understanding, and being considerate.	7	5		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11829	19104	7	My brother matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long.   We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with matts girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up atleast a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on. During those  couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking I did not hear matt have one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed matts girlfriend two dollars.	12	9		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

When my mom and I were siting in the deer blind she was getting her crossbow ready for when a deer came. But we were siting there for about @NUM1 hours. I was about to lose my patients but then some deer came in, a mother deer and her fawn. My mom didnt want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be all alone. So we waited for more deer to come in but none did. But I still had my patience in me. when it started to get cold and dark out we thought no more deer were going to come in so we just went home and plus my mom was starting to lose patient a little bit.

11831	19106	7	When I think about patience, I usually think of my mom, and how tolerant and understanding she is. Even when she has explained something to me about @NUM1 times and I still dont understand, she helps me without complaining. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. @CAPS1 was the @DATE1 time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my new bike. My dad had told me that you needed turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devestated that @CAPS1 wasnt easy, I gave up a little bit after. Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, turn! Turn! but @CAPS1 was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the grass. @CAPS1s okay. You almost had @CAPS1! mom said rushing over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again. Over and over, I tried to ride my bike. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up. On my one last try before @CAPS1 was time to go back in the house, my mom let go and I rode all by myself, around the corner and back! When I got back, we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed patience that day. She didnt let me give up and she never complained. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike!	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11837	19112	7	Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you dont have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didnt want to wait so she didnt look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldnt really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So thats what happens when you dont have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so thats my story about have patienes and what they can gave you. So you should always have patiences.	5	6		1				1.0	1.0	2.0	1.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

He saw the person I was with, which was my brother, play in a tournament downstate in @LOCATION1. The coach was there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team. He watched one of my brother's game and approached him after the game. They talked about the team and he told him that he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him and so he gave the coach our phone number and his e-mail address. The coach said he would contact him in @NUM1 days maximum. On our drive home my brother kept checking his e-mail because it took us @NUM1 days to get home. The @CAPS2 day the coach never called or e-mailed him. The second day still nothing. My brother was very patient for it to come and he never stressed out over it not coming. The third day on our trip back home my brother was very understanding when my mother told him that it might not happen. So we get home at @NUM3 o'clock and I am starting to doubt that my brother brother made the team. Then the phone rings. My brother talked for while then hung up and said he made the team.

Like most kids, I dont wine and fuss about waiting. In my head Im thinking when I whould get to go on the ride. I dont scream and shout though, I just try to stand still and wait. The second go on. tic tac tic tac. Just waiting for the line to get shorter and smaller. Minutes later it was finnaly my turn to go on the rollercoaster I was so exited! I went on the ride, it was fantastic! The only thing is that it was only a minute! that line that I had to wait in was like an hour. Well on well.

11846	19123	7	If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1s @CAPS1, thats a different story. Ill tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldnt be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldnt get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didnt help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if Im very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait.	11	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11858	19137	7	This is a story about a time when I was being patient waiting for a plain in an airport. We were on ar way to @LOCATION1 and we had to take two plains to get there. When we got off the plain to the second airport we went to go see what time our second flights comes in. when we found out the time for the second flight we were shocked because we had to wait six hours for it to come in. my mom told me I had to be patient but I am not good at being patient. To get things off my mind we decided to eat. When I was done eating. I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to get it out of my head. Only three hours had passed and it was annoying me. So I started to play my ds. Before I knew it we only had one hour left so playing my ds distracted me. I got impatient real fast, so thats when my sister and I started goofing around. All of a sudden our plain arrives I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learnt to be patient.	11	11		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11859	19138	7	There have been times where I had to be patient. This one time I went to the dentist we got there and we sat down. Let me tell you something I hate the dentist. So we probably sat there for an hour or two. But only one good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day. I think the worst place to go is the dentist and doctor. The one thing about the doctor is you dont have to wait as long. That means you can get and go. But sometimes you have to be patient. Like when you get a job or an interview. One good thing patience can get you to good places. Being patient is a polite way to go. So if your all prep you want to go down the patient way. Not being patient is just disrespect. Its like treating things like dirt. Patience is sort of like table manners, nice and proffessional. If I were you go patient it leads you to a good future.	7	6		2				1.0	0.0	3.0	3.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11860	19139	7	Patient is very important if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time. if there were no patience we wouldn`t be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out. Some people have no patience and others havetons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience.	5	6		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11861	19140	7	Patience, something you have to have when you want to be friends with someone. This story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just dont have patience. I was walking into the room where the speech competition was. I sat next to all my friends and the all thought I would get first place. When I went up with one of my friends he said that he had just alittle bit to much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didnt know what he was doing. @CAPS2 one actually knew that he and I were friends. After I went up to see what number I was I saw that I was the first one to speak. My friend said that I would do good, and he was right after me. I soon started to speak about lady @PERSON1 @CAPS1 loved my speech! After we my friend, @ORGANIZATION1 and I were done with our speeches we both sat next to eachother and were talking a lot. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, @CAPS2 way why would I be friends with him? then @CAPS1 laughed. We both looked at eachother, in a bad way. After a few days we wont talking to each other since @CAPS1 was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But ofcourse, @ORGANIZATION1 wasnt patient at all. He was eager to tell @CAPS1 that me and him were friends but we couldnt tell anyone because to them were both different, but the truth is that were both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basket ball, music and talking like @NUM1. Haha! Soon @CAPS1 found out. @ORGANIZATION1 had gone and told @CAPS1 that we were friends. Turns out @CAPS2 one laughed at us. They were actually happy that @ORGANIZATION1 had @CAPS2 patience and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and @ORGANIZATION1 are best friends and will be best friends forever! In conclusion, @CAPS3 having patience is a good thing but sometimes people cant have patience when they want to become friends.	8	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11865	19145	7	Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousins third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what theyre doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly. I learned an important lesson from my cousins birthday party  babysitting requires a lot of patience!	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11866	19146	7	@CAPS1!! I had another math home work assignment due tomorrow and I was tired of math already. Every day my fourth grade teacher would give us math home work that was really long and hard. Some days I would come home and cry because it was really hard. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient because it never worked for me. Every day I would come home sit down at the table and take my time, and doing work. @NUM1 problems a day was hard for a fourth grader. Whenever math started I would get out my homework and wait to check it. I never did terrible. @CAPS2 I was always proud of my work. But when it came to getting my homework assignment, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also challenging. I had to be patient and take my time. I had to be patient and take my time. One day my teacher gave us as easy lesson and I felt confident I could finish it at school. I came to a hard problem every once in a wile and I would stress out. But I remembered what my mom said, be patient and stay calm, @CAPS2 I did. I was patient and I worked through the problem. Now to this day I remember to be patient. I also remember what we will have to live with being patient all our lives. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

After another month I had asked my mom again and she said why dont you wait till @CAPS6. And once I went to my dads house he said @CAPS6 is just around the corner. But I said that everyone has it cant I just get it now. My dad said no, so then after that I had waited @NUM1 months thinking could he have his answer or maybe he changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my moms house and asked her she said that I should be able to wait and she also said if I ask again I wont get it.

My brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and @CAPS2 waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother. So I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully I had my @CAPS3 so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music. A few minutes later I went to the bathroom. When I got out a nurse told me to come with her, she lead me to the backroom with my brother and my grandma. I learned that the doctor didnt even start yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So for what seemed like days the doctor finally showed up. After a hour or so the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the amnesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy. It was actually funny. Finally we left and I didnt lose my patience.	8	10		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11893	19174	7	Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I dont know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didnt care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasnt like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I m daddys little girl? I think you couldve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. Thats when daddys little girl comes in handy!	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11904	19186	7	There is time in everyones life were they have to be patient. The time I was patient was when I was helping my brother learn how to tye his shoes. I know this sounds like an easy task but it really isnt. Time after time again my brother attempted to tye his shoes but could never do it. So I told him to go get one of his shoes and I will teach him. When we got started I thought this would be over in about five minutes but no! He could not make the bunny ears. So we tried and tried again. He would get so close to tying the knot and then he would get so excited he would pull the knot as hard as he could and the laces would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and just let him use his shoes with straps but no, he was determined to tye his shoes. After about an hour of tying he finally got it! He didnt tye them perfectly but it was good enough to keep them tyed I said good job and started to walk to the kitchen. When he asked about the double knot. So of course I walk over and tell him just cross the two bunny ears and loop around but he didnt get it. I had to have shown him a billion times how to do it! But he still didnt get it. We hit the half hour ??? for the double ??? and I went in the kitchen for a juice box. When it came back my brother had a smile on from cheek to cheek and held up his shoe proudley.	10	11		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11905	19187	7	At time I wsa very patient when I had to do a project on birds, which included a life size scale model. On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @NUM2 day project instead of a seven. I worked harder then @ORGANIZATION1, but I kept braking my wonderful creation. The wings would break, and I patiently had to glue them back on. I finally completed it, though it took way longer than I wanted to. I used paintence, carefulness, and steady hand to finally succeed!	8	11		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	2.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I told my @CAPS1 that I would be back in hopefully a half hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster by the park. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever.

Seconds pass by like hours your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies are the only class I have with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him staring at his perfect head. @DATE2 @CAPS1 the girlâs choice dance and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies I wrote him a note. â@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.â I chickened out, no way could I give it to him myself so, I devised a plan. I told @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to @CAPS3 @PERSON3 (who @CAPS1 @PERSON1âs friend) to @CAPS3 @CAPS2, (@PERSON1âs better friend) to @CAPS3 @PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2 but, now he knows, and now itâs @DATE1 and time for social studies. Patience @CAPS1 my essence I remind myself donât be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasnât because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally I leaned over and handed @PERSON1 my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little to patient seeing today @CAPS1 @DATE2 and the dance @CAPS1 tonight. At my locker, which @CAPS1 four and a doorway down from @PERSON1âs I have a note taped to it. It reads â@CAPS3 me your phone number and Iâll call you for the @NUM1.â. Gosh! Boys are so confusing I @CAPS3 him my number and wait by the phone. I think heâs testing my patience I wait for what feels like hours by my phone willing to ring. I felt like breaking down, giving up, and then a rush of will power would come back and @CAPS3 me it would be worth it in the end.

11916	19198	7	Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told you@CAPS1 be patient? Recently @CAPS2 been patient. My family got a new microwave and its too big for our counter so we had to put it above our stove. Well there wasnt enough space above the stove so my parents decided to remadle the whole kitchen. My step mom took everything out of the kichen and put it all over dinning room, and now we can barely walk in the dinning room .Lately my family has been eating in our living room. (@CAPS3) I really dont like eating in our living room it @CAPS1 seems so gross. But we also have the option to eat outside on our porch. So thats a good thing. Idont know how much longer I can keep up with this. But @CAPS2 @CAPS1 got to be patient. Finally now my dad has made a new shelf and he can put up our new microwave, finish painting, and put our stove back. After he did that my step mom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away and how we are back to normal. After being patient it really pays off. Now you know to always be patient.	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11917	19199	7	It was a nice warm sunny @DATE1 day!!! We decided we could go pick up every one from my dads house and go to the genesee county farm. We got to my dads house and pick up my step brother, step sister, real brother, step mom, and my dad. We start heading to the genesee county farm. We started walking around waiting to see if it was going to rain. If it was going to rain that would be a waist of money. We walk up to the ticket booth to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same wrist bands if it starts raining. They said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer then it starts poring down rain. We had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. Meanwhile the barn starts flooding. Then we get phone calls saying that tornados just hit a few miles away. Finaly it stopped raining and we all go back outside. We waited for the rides to start back up. Once they finally started back up the rain started back up. So we all ran to the car. We were soaking wet. We decided to stop trying on the fair and do something else. So instead we all went out and ate toco bell and burger tong.	8	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11920	19202	7	I am patient. Even though I hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was @NUM1 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dads house. She forgot that he had to work @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I @MONTH1 add has never changed, even @NUM4 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around doing nothing. that is until I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about @NUM5 hours and still had almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would @CAPS1 have touched it. But I did. I was only @NUM1! I dont really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because its implanted to my brain.

11923	19205	7	Are you a patient person? Well Im not! Well, I can be patient I just wont like to be. A few years ago my family got a gordon setter puppy. Since theyre kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. its hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them @NUM1! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didnt want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11927	19209	7	A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vaction to @CAPS1. The first night we got there my eye was starting to itch and became all red. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctors office but there wasnt one around but we found an ergent care. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally the nurse called out @ORGANIZATION1. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok Ill be right back. Then me and my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really unpatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vaction. Thats a time where I was patient.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11930	19212	7	There has been many times I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one will intrest you most. Finaly we get to go to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is this big indoor water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I have been wanting to go here for years. When we get there my first thought is paradise little did I know that there was the biggest lines I have ever seen. And the lines were not just for the rides they were for every thing. In two days of fun it is already our last day at @CAPS1. So I wanted to ride all the rides one more time. my mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we can go to the park. So I did. When we got to the park the shortest line I saw was probably an hour long. I was so disappointed I only got to go on like @NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave paradise. We left around @NUM2 thinking we would be home by about @NUM3. And we were on our way back home. I was so bored it felt like it has been @NUM4 but really it has only been one hour. It was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly. I asked my mum when we were going to get home she said just be patient. So I just went along with it and sucked it up. @CAPS3 we are home. I say running inside. In my head I am thinking that was the longest ride ever. I look over at the clock it was @NUM5. @NUM6 longer then we thought. But I had to go to bed right then (dans it no video games). That is a time I displayed patcience.	8	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	1.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11931	19213	7	I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in on ????? would have lot of people wait in line to the ??? , if you're patient you would wait but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might you now when you are patient??? Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. Though wait things ??? , which is not nice. Im conclusion I believe that being patient is very important in life.	5	7		2				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11932	19214	7	I have been patiencent a lot of times but right now me and my friends are saving up to meet @PERSON1! Thats alot of patience just for one ticket its @MONEY1! So just imagine how long you have to wait to save that much money! Its hard being patience it exspecially when your are going to meet a celebirtly that you have the hugest crush on! I have been patiencent a lot during this process of saving up money. No matter how hard its going to be I can do it with patience. My friends and have been patiencent and still are. I meant could you stay patiencent if you were goning to meet your favorite celebirty that you love? Well its not that easy first off it takes a lot of patience to do chores and take care of your animals, plus count how much money you have. And when people borrow your money that really sets you back. But like said no matter what we are going to save up @MONEY1 plus tat to meet him and we are going to be patiencent the whole time we save up. It is a lot of fun because you get to learn a few lessons and you get to see and learn how to become patiencent. Overall patience is every where and you use patience in a lot of different things in life.	7	8		2				2.0	2.0	1.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11934	19216	7	Have you ever been patient? I know it is hard for me to be patient! I usually am not patient because I really like things done right then and there, I dont really like to wait. I can be patient! I can be patient when I am waiting short periods of time. Usually I like to rush, not on my work, but socially, I rush! Being patient means to wait, usually without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you are going to a party at @TIME1 and it is @NUM1, you have to wait for a long time! Usually the time seems to go slow! Patience is a quality that is important. That is why I am working hard to try to be patient.

11939	19222	7	I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: @CAPS1. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught @CAPS1 how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting @CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @CAPS1 to go to the deep end of the pool but I was to afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he shouldve realized I wouldnt just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with @CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @CAPS1. I told him if he stayed, Id go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasnt so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. Thats how my friends hard work and patience payed off for both @CAPS1, and him.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

From the beginning of the @DATE1 I had checked the mail box every day.  Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""@CAPS2 is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me.  Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2.

11944	19227	7	To write about a time I was patient is hard for me to do so since I am not a patient person, but I am going to try. Three days before the trip to cedar point can not wait for it to be here. I did try to make it rush by, but it didnt work. I had been off of school now for @NUM1 weeks and I had did everything I wanted to do. When me my mom, sister and friends go we always have a lot of fun (of corce). Every night since , I have known we are going to cedar point I would sit there and think one day when many kids would ask and complain to there mom saying,  cant it come anymore, but me never, not one I know that no one could make time go by faster. So I waited did my chores, packed and watched tv. Trust me it was very long, very boring and is itching at me to complain but I didnt. I took a deep breath every time, this would happen to me. And say only a little wait compared to other things. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to cedar point. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do and do while waiting for cedar point to come along. This is what patient is to me, and in my life. This is also a time in my life when I was patient.	11	12		3				2.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

Its a its a grouse? I glowered the gun calmed down and watched it eat some corn. It was @NUM3. time for lunch and all I had was a turkey sandwhich, a apple, and a bottle of water. I started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when I  saw a brown figure move. I grabed my gun with my apple in my mouth. So picture @TIME2 a guy with all come on. An apple in his mouth, and look in a scope. As I looked  I realized it was him the big @NUM4. Massive horns, a big body and he was proble five maby six years old. I put my crosshairs just be hind the shoulder and I diehed the safety off. Slowly pulled the trigger. My mind a blur and @CAPS4! perfect shot. Later @TIME2 I found him and he was big @NUM5.

How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe??? so much there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldnt believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do, if its along time, but its also a good thing to do because it pays with every time.	9	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11951	19234	7	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every mustle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes scanning the crows. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And than I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stoped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldnt just go running off I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening.	8	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11952	19236	7	This a story about a time when I was patient. It was the @NUM1 @DATE1  we were on the plane about to go on a cruise, when we got to the ship I was so excited I was  thinking how much fun I was gonna have, think what my room would look like, and going to all these cool new places. So we got on the dock and there wa a line and I was patient an waited to get on, @CAPS1 there was another line to check your passport, so I was patient and waited. @CAPS1 there was another sticken line. It was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again and just stood there for a little bit and it was done, but wait you would never guess, there was another line. So like all the other lines I stood there on my iPod listening to music. They my dad said ready, I said ready for what another line he said no to look at your room and relax . I was so excited. Finally we where done with the lines no more for a white. So I open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing. But the bath room was a little small but it was great. I was so happy to final done with the lines no more! That is a time when I was patient.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11953	19237	7	One time I was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street. I walked there, taking in the scene of the sun going down and the young ones playing and laughing carelessly. A @CAPS1 boarder waved at me but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a weird o. not to be mean or anything. I finally got there and knocked on the door. She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward ''oh, hi @CAPS2!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, through. That was a time I was patient.	11	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11955	19239	7	Being patient! Patience is a good learning skill. The three step to being patient, being quiet, not complaining, and waiting a while if you have to. My mom and I went hunting with @PERSON1, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and l was dressed warm but I was still could. There was a little heater in the shead thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good. When l was about to ask if we could go in a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the doer to come closer. @PERSON1 loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran of. Purted shot! We got out of the shead and searched for a blood trial. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was wroth it. The right way to be patient, shuting your mouth, not wining and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient.

11956	19240	7	Being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a @DATE1 and my mom woked me up at @NUM1 she say we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didnt know that I was going to have to be paitent the whole day. First on our way to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about @NUM2 mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about @NUM3 mins. I told my mum Im ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another @NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life.	9	7		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11957	19241	7	At one @CAPS2 in left you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody thats patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didnt know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11959	19243	7	Patience in @CAPS1: Understanding and being toterant is what makes up patience. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to them team, youre time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game the carman  @PERSON1 girls @CAPS1 team was going against flushing. A young lady from flushing not fouled (I didnt even see it, truth be told Im not even sure if it happen but you cant argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! Im surprised her shot wasnt took. What was she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didnt say anything. I just stood nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) she didnt make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself ,I felt really happy for myself. Im just now realizing that, that whole time I was standing there is didnt a face, or say anything or think something in my head! I was just standing tall for the first minding my own business and untelling to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now bar out) I just assumed the box out position. Sit down, but down hands out and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposite! Nobodys perfect, youll have to wait and see who will score the next point!	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

Some times you will be sitting for hours and hours just waiting on the one shot. I remember when I was  hunting with my dad @CAPS1 sitting under a tree fro probablee three hours and finally a turkey came, unfortunutly just about when I had a shot my dad scared them all away but I still had the patience to stay out there for another @NUM1 hours. That is my example of patience.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11963	19247	7	In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something dont rush because you can mess up. Dont go way to slow because then people will think you dont know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who dont have patience arent always happy all the time.	5	8		2				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11964	19248	7	Have you ever had to be patient before? I have and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday my uncle @CAPS1 promised me a phone but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then @DATE2 finally came, more months passed and i still hadnt heard from my uncle. I began to become fustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my haad A little its been almost a year! Then on @DATE1 my uncle came over for my family reunion.Then he told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. I  knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldnt have forgotten about. Soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the @CAPS2 touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon. To conclude this story I want to say patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life.

11966	19250	7	One time I was patient was when I had to get some @CAPS1 done and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my @CAPS1. She told me she would be only a few minutes. So I waited, I decided to watch an episode of spongebob while I waited. As the episode ended I went back to the computer. She still wasnt done! So I made some bagel bites which are pizza on a mini bagel. I ate @NUM1... and so on I got to @NUM2 and I started getting full. But I kept eating. I ate and ate. I was really hungry. I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but yet she wasnt. I went outside to go play some sports with my friends. We were out there for about @NUM3 @CAPS2 got tired and eventually we all went home. As I walked in the door I looked at the computer it was still in use. I went to go take a bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and soothing. I got out. I went upstairs to change. I came downstairs and surprisingly my mom was off! I went to get on but she came in and said time for bed, so I woke up early to do my @CAPS1. This took a lot of patience because it was hard to wait so long.	11	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11974	19259	7	Patience is a hard thing to have, but there is rewards to having it. I had a teacher that no one could remember to gave us our report card in band class. So after a few weeks I made a bet with him that if he didnt bring us our report card the next day he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally. It was the end of the year. And he still didnt have them. Once schools started up again and we were half way through the school year and mey band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of swittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said?? yes are only suppose to give me and  he told me  the second one is ? being to patient.	7	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	1.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11975	19260	7	Patience is a valuable thing. Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do @CAPS1 practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It take patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every @DATE2 and @DATE1 I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to @CAPS1 go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play @CAPS2 year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isnt when your sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting.	9	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11976	19261	7	The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom dont have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you dont have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients! And rember pacents is the key thing to sucsses!	10	7		2				3.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

11981	19266	7	Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times Im not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year Im not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you dont  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasnt gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself be patient over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldnt do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me @CAPS2! @CAPS3 wouldnt let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. Thats a time Ill never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. Thats how I was patient, and Im glad I was patient with my legs. Im not very patient so thank goodness for patience!	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11984	19270	7	Im constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time Im able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked @CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up? @CAPS2 responded with patience and years of practice. The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom @CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later? @CAPS2 replies @CAPS4, @CAPS9? I answered @CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with. @CAPS6. @CAPS2 says. When we get there, therere @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didnt go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said @CAPS8, I know youll catch on soon! and I wondered out loud @CAPS9?, @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.	12	10		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	3.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11985	19271	7	When my @CAPS2 and I got into the checkout line at @CAPS1, @CAPS6 heard impatient groans and signs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My @CAPS2 continued her cheerful whistling, and didnt seem to notice. @CAPS2 this is going to take forever! I whined. @CAPS3t be so negative. Its not that long. @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my responding glare and chuckled. @CAPS5 about @CAPS6 play a game? @CAPS6 continued a game of eye spy for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied! As @CAPS6 walked out of the store my @CAPS2 said, @CAPS7, when youre patient, you get food! @CAPS6 both laughed and drove home.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

Everyone in my family that goes is me, my mom and my dad,(???). my little sister, my three cousins, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents. We all stay in one big hotel together, which usually has @NUM1 bedrooms. Out of the whole year we only stay for two weeks. So I have to be very patient the other three hundred and fifty one days. While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays, hang out on the beach and swim in the ocean or the pool. So it is absolutely worth the wait. I always have a great time and now I wait patiently for next year.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11987	19273	7	I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to @PERSON1 point. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didnt mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to the ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic. Finally, all of my patience had payed off, and I had a great day.	10	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

11995	19282	7	Being patience is what you need to get anything done in the world. One example is school how do you use patience. A way is being understanding to your teacher because theyre there to help you to teach you for life. If you dont be patient and understand your teacher you will get nowhere in life. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them they were tolerant with you. If you dont have patience with you parents and dont listen to them then you wont learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you will get nowhere in life.	5	5		1				0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

11996	19283	7	Once I knew a girl whos name was @ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @PERSON1. They had been inseperable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular. @PERSON1 called @ORGANIZATION1 everyday to see how she was and or if she wanted to hangout. @ORGANIZATION1 kept lieing to @PERSON1 saying she was busy and always said lies and blowing her off. But one day @ORGANIZATION1 had a very bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized how she was acting. @ORGANIZATION1 had learned that @PERSON1 really was a true friend and was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient only good thing can come.	8	10		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box. Alls I did was sit in a chair and watch him. He finally got the x-box fixed after about seven or eight hours. Once me and my friend began to play the game it broke again. So then we had to take the game to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and have them look at it. I had to have patients because if I didnt I would have been really bored. Once @CAPS1 @CAPS4 looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it. I t took @CAPS1 @CAPS4 almost four days to fix the system and return it to me, so I had to have patients so the system could be delivered. Patients is a very needy thing in life.

12008	19297	7	A time when I was patient. I am patient when I go hunting. I know that at an moment the back of a life time could walk out in shouting range. And if one does I will be ready. The first time I shot a deer was with my baw. And I remember siting there being as patient as I could waiting for a deer to step within range. Then l hear the leaves cranching . The there it is the deer Im going to shout?? How you draw it back. Than I shoot I could feel the arrow gliding throw my bow. Then the arrow hits the deer with a thud and the deer takes off. I wanted there in my tree stand ready to go blame my deer. Me and my dad traked it about soft and there it was. I was so excited that all yelled. It was nice to know that all my patients and hard work had payed of. Thank you for reading my story. Hope you enjoyed it.	10	9		3				2.0	2.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

12011	19301	7	I remember when I went to @LOCATION1 to visit my step-grandmother for @CAPS1 and went fishing. I didnt really went to do it because I am a very impatient person. The creek we were going to fish in was right behind her house. I grabbed a fishing rod and went into the backyard. I flung my fishing lips into the water and waited. After maybe @NUM1 minutes or nothing (except my sister who caught most things.) The finally started to unravel. Excited, I kept out of my seat, knocking it over, and grabbed the real. Twisting and twisting the handle for what seemed like forever, I brought it up. The fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later. My step grandmother threw the fish back. After another @NUM1 minutes I became frustrated and went to swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving and I got up, and twisted the reel faster then ?? Id caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited an entire hour for my line to move. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my rod and told my step grandmother. My patience lead up to me catching the biggest fis of the day and learning something new.	10	12		3				2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

12012	19302	7	Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So Im happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.	7	4		1				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

12014	19304	7	This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my stor and what patience mean to me.	6	4		1				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

As you might know now, @CAPS2 are in an airport full of people. @CAPS2 had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 took a lot of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was really really bored. I had nothing to play with besides my gameboy @CAPS6. The gameboy @CAPS6 is a boxy looking object that folds open. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only fun that I could use to keep me busy and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But thankfully I found a @CAPS8.V. that they had at the airport. @CAPS2 went over to the @LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @CAPS2 could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all so I played my gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I haven@CAPS8 said anything to my @CAPS1 the past two hours or three hours. I didn@CAPS8 want to bug her so I left her alone. When the next hour passed,@CAPS2 boarded our plane finally. @CAPS2 waited a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS3 was a painful but memoriable experience.

We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world; @CAPS3 @CAPS4. @CAPS5 down, @PERSON1, my @CAPS2 told me. Im coming, she said. Im not usually super hyper, but I just love roller coasters. Its also nice to just take a @DATE1 off and @CAPS1 up to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I live in @LOCATION1, so the drive isnt that short. My @CAPS2 had just finished giving the man our tickets. @CAPS6 your day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, he told us. @CAPS9, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first? my @CAPS2 asked me. @CAPS10 about the @CAPS11? I asked my @CAPS2 @CAPS12 not? she replied. By the way if you didnt know my name is @PERSON1. But thats not important right now. Whats important is getting on the @CAPS11. My @CAPS2 and I waited in the line for about an hour. It seemed to take a while, but before I knew it, we were buckling up. Now I know the @CAPS11 isnt the biggest ride, but its still pretty big. The @CAPS4 is, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we were going uphill, everything started to get smaller, and I started to get more nervous. The @CAPS11 ended up being a blast! After the @CAPS11 we rode the mantis, the @ORGANIZATION1, the wicked @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS17, The mean @CAPS18, the @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 and the @CAPS22. @CAPS23 right @PERSON1, pick the last ride, my @CAPS2 said @CAPS24 that was easy. We still hadnt gone on my favorite ride yet. @CAPS25s go on the @CAPS26 force, I said. We got in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. @CAPS24,  Ive been on the ride, and its definitely worth it. The wait ended up being a bit longer. The wait was four hours, and I wanted to leave after three. I waited, though, and even though I thought it wouldnt be worth it, I waited. It was totally worth it. The waiting was terrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and Im glad I waited for the best ride.	12	11		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	2.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

12024	19315	7	I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for somebody to do something. One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm. It, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do!!! Patience is also about waiting for your ??? like when you are bored.	7	5		2				0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

But we have to be careful so principal doesnt take our privellages away, @CAPS1 example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, shell take it away from us.

I will talk about when go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours max ten hours. They just dont go to one mall and stop they go to at least two mall three max. They go to a lot of strip malls too for exsample simply fashion and things like rainbow. They are going to a hundred place for at least eight hours my feet start to hurt and im getting hungry and tired but, I dont complain because I am being patient.

Then, she asked us if we would like anything to drink. I told our waitress I would like a diet pepsie. My sister got a fruit punch. As always. My mom and dad got a mountain dew. My brother got cherry pepsie. I dont know why we all got different drinks. It took @NUM1 minutes to get our drinks though. My dad wasnt so patient. He knew that the food will take forever. Finally our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. The wait for that was @NUM2 minutes. My dad was very impatient. I was the only patient one at our table. The resturaunt wasnt even that busy. I told my dad to just be patient the food will be right out any minutes. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. We ate all the food, got the bill, then left. That was the time I was patient.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	1.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

I was turning ten soit was a big deal for me. We all ready had the cake which was decorated in beautiful yellow and white frosting. It also had a picture of horses running @CAPS4 it and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS4 it. The party started at @NUM2 am. I was in my pretty pink flowered dress and putting streamers up. I keeped @CAPS4 asking what the time was, and my mom would just say to be patient. I had to wait. I was a very impatient girl. I was just so excited I couldnt wait. I then remembered that I was supposed to be patient so I was. I played games and read books while I was waiting for the guests. Then before I knew it the door bell rang and all my family came running in with presents and curds. I guess all that waiting really payed off. I also got some really cool presents.	12	10		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

I stood next to my best friend @CAPS1. On the other side of the stage was our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while  @PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shock are heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to @CAPS3 house and thought about what to write. @PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to @CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decid on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in.

After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said @PERSON3 and @CAPS1 have won first place.

We couldnt find the right one. @CAPS1 took @NUM1 weeks til we saw the cutest chichuacua. He was only one year old. We were rushing through the papers scared some one else was planning to adopt him. When we turned @CAPS1 in the lady said we had a back side too. After the paper work we had to wait another week because they had  to fix him. My mom went shopping for dog store they told us we could pick him up on @DATE2. We were so excited. Instead of @DATE2 we thought we could pick him up on @DATE1. On that @DATE1 we picked him up @CAPS1 took @NUM2 years of patience for my sister and only @NUM3 years for me. A year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog.We didnt find one, but we waited and if your patient you will get something for that.

12067	19360	7	I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teachers or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teachers demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, Id see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. Thats not the only time but, its the most longest time I was patient with some one.	10	8		2				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

I just dont try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatience I am is Im at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars I wont save up for the ten dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candys. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I cant spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because it dont want to and until they give it back most the time that happened. I get grounded but item worth it because I get candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom say no I always sneak it and get in trouble. @NUM1 words.	9	7		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

We went to the @ORGANIZATION1 for children. In the beginning, I was at home getting ready to go. I put on an orange turtle neck sweater and jeans with sneakers. I didnt want to go because it was after @CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive. My dad filled out the information then we sat. In the middle, we start to watch television. I was really bored because it was nothing on but informercials. They had us waiting fo over an hour. I start to get hungry and very upset.  They finally called our name. In the end it was time to get my shot. The nice lady gave me a juice. Then she told me I was getting @NUM2 shots. I got my shots which took a very long time, I was frustrated, I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we got @CAPS2.Donalds. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots. The information I got was just as painful as getting my shots. They had us wait for a very long time. I was sad to have to wait but happy it was over.	8	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

12072	19366	7	Being patient, what does it mean? It means that; you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didnt complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didnt want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldnt! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didnt think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didnt want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!	8	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

12086	19382	7	A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didnt just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins wont change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldnt think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I dont think that Ill be able to count my coins again, but like they say, Patience is a virtue.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

12090	19386	7	I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the @ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!	10	12		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

12096	19392	7	My at saying your patient is. Your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient. Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that.	8	4		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	1.0	1.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

You wait until you get to the top, then you splash down a hill. Well, that was one of everyones favorite rides, so there was a long line. We had to wait for a half hour to ride it once. So, in order to do something, it takes time so you must be patient. If your not patient you probably want get to do what you wanted to do.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

12099	19395	7	Patience is the ability to be tolerant,understanding and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isnt  something they teach you in my school. There isnt a book your assigned to read called  patience @NUM1,there is no movie called patience is the key. Non of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and its not at all wat  i had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold bench next to  the strength meter at a county fair. What people really dont understand is the patience that is put in to being a spy. Sure theres an ocasional car being blown up bet  not today, not for me. I here the clock in my hand so tick,tock,tick,tock. @CAPS3  @CAPS2, theres come action. The subject (the person Im assigned to watch is on the move and, oh, nevermind, all the subject has done is bay a three dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodlle a design in the dirt, with my foot. Im just about to abort the mission. Seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with finger print revealing mist. A purple fluffy cloud of vapor sorround the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes. I see that the subjects fingerprints are on the chip, I pull out my laptop at insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if Im able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but a tablecloth, Im sure I can sit here and just be patient.  At least twenty minutes have gone by now but i feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 wassucsessful. @CAPS2! I say aloud and people start to stare, but I dont mind. I click the square on the screen that says open. @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says @CAPS4 me at the ice cream pallor. I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone , and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf diaped over her head are the only two people standing by the icecream stand. I walk a little bit closer and i realise that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcaffs ofcoure, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to sucsesfully complete  my mission without being  patient.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

He told me to wait a second, but I wasnt waiting a second I was waiting for hours. My mom couldnt wait any longer she was about to take me home. I told her to be patient and it would fill like time is going faster .She said, she is going to try, but if it didnt work were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor  room above the sink on the dresser, after  I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand.

That when I told her mom I older now, Im not sorle years old, Im muture now. She said @CAPS1 go ahead so I went over sat next to some girls and talked to them. Thats when we got up and start walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying your mom is still following you so I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down we ate and everything, and I so happen to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Thats when went back on the elevator on the to our original place and sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there. That when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said was you following me and she replied yes I mean no. so I had a talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story.	8	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on @DATE1 twenty second. That day my mom wasnt even breaking a sweat. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags(which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sisters face I almost started to cry. I knew I was going to love her and she was going to be just as patient as I was.	11	9		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

Dad, mum, @CAPS1 and I were going to see buddy guy and @CAPS3 was going to be a @NUM1 and a half hour concert. As we pulled in the parking lot, the policeman guard pointed to the open parking spot for the jeep and we drove into @CAPS3. We got out and drank pop and ate sand whiches because we had an hour or so before the concert started. After @NUM3 minutes, or maybe @NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a spot to sit on the hill. Once we sat down, time stopped I waited and waited until I thought about @NUM5 minutes had passed. I was expecting buddy to walk on stage any second, but @CAPS2 never did. After what seemed @NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked âhow long has @CAPS3 been since we sat down?â âabout five minutes.â @CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. âhow long?â âsix now.â @CAPS3 wouldnât have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. âThe performance will start in @NUM7 minutes.â @CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over. Finally after @NUM7 minutes of dying and waiting, @CAPS2 walked on stage. @CAPS3 was the best sight in the world. @CAPS3 was worth the long, long wait and I enjoyed @CAPS3 even more.

I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our  three day stay at  @ORGANIZATION1.  I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrased  @CAPS4 I didnt care.  I finally snapped to it and kept my cool.  In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 I was stuck ahead how to make my ??? of @ORGANIZATION1 & friend  in my group named @PERSON1  told me some ideas, @CAPS4 I wanted to have her @CAPS4 ??? @CAPS4 I stayed collected and listened to her ideas and I have to say, they werent bad. I thought about ??? of the ??? and used it in my pamting. ??? now were at the nearly @NUM1 feet high ??? ladder  I  already took my ??? going up and zipping down the awesome get scary @CAPS3. I was now helping keep people up the ladder. I was patient @CAPS4 man, they took forever! I was about to scream at this one dude, @CAPS4 I said to myself be patient. @CAPS4 this on kid named @CAPS5, sometimes he  just sat right on one of the big planks of word. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response  was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most.	10	12		3				3.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I don't interapt them while they are talking I wait to make sure they are done talking before I start to talk. Another thing is being polite, I am polite in class an at home I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink, or getting your lunch, or going in a single file line for a firedrill.  You can also be nice and patient if someone isn't done you can help them out and that would be really nice and patient.

12157	19459	7	Patience is a quality that some people have and some people dont. it shows your character to people if your patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. Its not very hard just keep yourself occupied!	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

12160	19463	7	A time when I was being very patient was when I went to @CAPS1 at ceider point.. I went to ceider point with my @NUM1 aunties and my @NUM1 cousins. It was just the older girls going, because we new if we took the little people we couldnt go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one. It was so fun until we got to the lines. They were rediculasly long. I mean it literaly took us about an hour in a half to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time. We were in the back of the whole part, called The dead zone, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say were going to hold of for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesnt have any mechanical problems. Thats when my cousins went off. We tried to get her to calm down. So we all just sat down a waited. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the top of the rollercoaster @CAPS3. We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, mabey because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funest rides in the whole park called The mauerie. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun. We were a little patient, but did we enough patients to get back on, I dont think so.	10	11		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

12164	19467	7	I think that patience is about waiting instead of rushing things .If you be patient things will actually come faster than you think for example if you want something and you have to wait in line instead of running off and finding  something else at and wait it will always help. Be patient with what even your doing just be patience even if its waiting run school to be even. If your waiting for a same at stem to come sat have patience a wait because it might keep you out of trouble. Be patient what even  your  doing  even if your waiting for a turn just wait it is not a big deal stop rushing things, just be very patient.	5	6		1				0.0	2.0	2.0	1.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

12167	19470	7	There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up its distracting. Now that youve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Lets say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten	9	6		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole without complaining, then I guess there are some times when Ive been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didnt complaine once.

She wanted tickets to his concert, but when the sold out online she didnt know anywhere else to get them. She didnt know anywhere else to get them. She saw on the news that the were giving away tickets the morning of the concert. She wanted to be first in line. Well so did everyone else. She got there at @NUM1 am and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket both. Finally when she got to the front, she got her tickets. She was patient and did not complain. Later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1s face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result. Maybe if my cousin would had been so patient she would have gotten the tickets. Patients will get you @NUM2 long way, especially if it trying to gain respect.

Well , yesterday, I was very patient my sister, @PERSON2 throws tons of fits and she is very bratty. I dont know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Heres the story. We were walking home yesterday. Everything was going fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean. Well our room was clean, and I wouldnt let @PERSON2 go up to clean  it. She screamed at the top of her lungs and cried. @MONTH1 I remind you, shes ten. She stormed up the stairs and she was on the phone with her. friend @PERSON1. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet zazin she screamed. So our sister, @ORGANIZATION1 got @NUM1 said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1s  text messages. Ill admit @PERSON1 wasnt being very nice. So we told @PERSON2 to not answer the phone. We werent yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. Im not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!	9	12		3				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

12196	19502	7	Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and youd have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an epicfail. But I still live. Playing the piece isnt so bad, its just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I dont have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all.  Who says Im going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. Im not really looking forward to this years @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping Im not going to get any homework. But if I do, Ill just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. Ill have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can live. All that is on my mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly.	12	12		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

12199	19505	7	Patience is something is most people dont have. In the story, patience was something that I needed. If I didnt have patience in the story, I dont know what I would do. This is my story. A couple years ago, I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we were there, she asked if I wanted to come in. thinking about all of the reasons why I dont, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least @NUM1 @CAPS1 outside. I was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasnt out of the store. There was so many times where I wanted to be angry, but I didnt let myself get this way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store. It was at least two hours before my mom had finally come out, I wasnt mad at her, I just understood her reasons and apologies why she was late. Most of the time I am not a patience person. Actually, I am never patient for situations like that. I was so glad I was patient for this story.	8	9		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

12201	19507	7	Two years ago, my two year old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start doing paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair to them. They let almost @NUM1 people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first. They had to go all the way to @LOCATION3 from where they lived, which was @LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her. Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didnt sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2. She would sleep during the day and wakeup at night they eventually taught her to sleep during the night. That girl took a lot of patience but she was finally adopted.	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

We sat on the couch and I helped him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didnt know how to do any of it. So I had to sit there and teuch him how to do it, and then explain how I got the answer. And did I mention that he had three pages to do. It was almost two hours before we were done with it all.

12216	19522	7	On @DATE1 my friend @CAPS1 and I climbed on the bus headed for @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS1 and I were with our church group, and we were together till @NUM1 am. We had been riding all diffrent rides all day and we got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign out front said wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours, but we were going to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started a @NUM5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnixous screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said @CAPS5 go on the @CAPS6 all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tounge. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did.	12	10		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			2.0	3.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldnt sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling.  Finally we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty. We also went to @ORGANIZATION1 and had an awesome time. I had to be patient at @ORGANIZATION1 since there were long lines for the rides, so we had to wait a while.

12218	19524	7	Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball.  There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular.                My first one is when people dont pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people dont pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on.  There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on.  My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team.  We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over.   The newest member of the team can not make a shot.  She doesnt put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasnt, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  Im  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?  Probably not on any teams or in any clubs.	12	7		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

12219	19525	7	I remember a time when I was patient, it was kind of hard to just there waiting on the doctor to call my name. But I suffered through it. Instead of me getting mad about how the lady havent called my name yet, after waiting like @NUM1 minutes. I just turned my @NUM2 player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine.  Before I knew it @CAPS2 called my name, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 said with a smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room @CAPS2 directed me in. When I left the doctors office and I was going on I thought to myself maybe being patient isnt that bad after all!	9	8		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

12220	19526	7	Almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctors or in the hospital. What I do to pass time when Im at the doctors is play I spy. I play it with my mom every time. There is usually a lot of people at the doctors when I go. There is magazines but I think they are boring. Therefore I play I spy to stay patient. Otherwise I would be very very bored.	6	6		2				1.0	2.0	1.0	2.0			1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I cant leave you at the house all @DATE1.

This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 countys only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16.

Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, @CAPS12, why dont you play with little @PERSON4? @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting little @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when theyve asked to play one for the billionth time. @CAPS2 we need to talk. @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side, honey, youve got to understand that kids need patience and love.

12224	19530	7	I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom can decide when I would get my phone. It was a @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school but I was acting very patient  so my mom would think its time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasent little angel.

The next day @DATE1 I cooked my mom some breakfast and I was satisfied that it as the day to get my phone. Nope she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face she was waiting for me to burst one shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome, although I was feeling intense. The next @TIME1 I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am so I dressed very professional\ casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress I ate, and I had walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said @CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get something I smiled so  hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friends house and I wondered my ma said wait @CAPS2 me still wondering   watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire I left at my friends house. I was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. @DATE5 the last day for the week. I dint do anything but mop all day.  I was still being patient though.

Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we always fought over something, so my sister came up and grabed the ball from me and when we were in the middle of fighting my mom told me to just stand and let her have the ball shell just walk away. So then I stood there patiently and waited. My sister ended up getting so bored she just droped the ball and left, she did exactly as my mom had said, then when I was playing basketball again she ran up and took the ball, so I just went inside and played videogames.	6	8		2				1.0	1.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

I had completed in. it was seven in the @TIME1 when we left the rink. We went get a bite to eat and went back to the rink when we were finished. My best friend @PERSON1 also was in the same event I competed in. I knew she would make it to the @DATE1, but I didnt know if I would or not. After a endless wait they were about to call out the people who made it. I kept saying over and over again in my head my number I was given.  They called @PERSON1s number. I was waiting for my number to still be called, but they never called it. I had not made it. I was disapointed, but I couldnt do anything about it.	10	9		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

To have @CAPS1 it ??? to ???  to get the job done that has a long process you might have to wait for an example I have to have @CAPS1 all the time. for like football, hockey and all the active things I do you have to have @CAPS1. As you know adults probably have any more @CAPS1 than teenagers like myself.  like if I were to sit in my blind with my father all day! Like he does it never does happen. Now when I become more grown up and an adult Iâll hopefully have way more @CAPS1 and be able to sit in the blind all day with my father. I also do have to say Iâm getting better with @CAPS1, because my dad preaches and preaches to me about @CAPS1, @CAPS2 hopefully when Iâm an grown adult Iâll be able to have some good @CAPS1 like my dad.	8	6		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

12245	19555	7	To say really Im not a very patient person, but once I was, I dont really know how. I was waiting in line to pay for some earphones. I loved those earphones they were blue my favorite color. So I was waiting @NUM1 minutes passed then @NUM2 then I lost track of time but I knew it was a long time. Then the cashiers were having trouble with the registers. So I waited longer and longer until some people were trying to fix it. Then I had to wait even longer. I guess I stayed in that line for more than an hour. I really loved those earphones but as much as I wanted them I just couldnt wait any longer. I @CAPS1 and put the earphones aside and left the store. I was really mad that day. Two weeks later we came back luckily the earphones were just where I put them.

12246	19556	7	One day, my mom was really patient. We were outside this talking to each other. My grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said yes. So I went and packed some things to take because they dont have anything. So when we hopped in the car, turned on the radio and was all fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my sub. I was fine until I got a test saying my cousins were over there. I was so mad but my mom this kept her eyes on the road. I was keep on screaming and saying mom go faster, but she this ignored me. It was like it went through one ear out the other. Then I got a text saying were gonna be playing football in like @NUM1 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said I dont know of course my brother was already over there because he spent the @TIME1. It was a bad @TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but didnt listen. So then I was going to ignore her. That didnt work because she didnt talk. So I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I went for bed forever, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot. I was devasted. I yelled out the window and said why. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer didnt reply. So I screamed it again and she yelled back here. I looked out the window and we were here. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I dont know why she didnt talk. Maybe she this wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. That was the time my mom was patient.	11	8		3				3.0	3.0	3.0	2.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant.

12247	19557	7	"Awhile back my friends and I made a @CAPS2 game called ""@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2"". I had just taken a great sniping position. I had a great angle in all but one direction. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods, @CAPS3 usually it didn't require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people that were playing. I aim my weapon and fired, @CAPS4 to the rules he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, @CAPS3 I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to @CAPS1 @CAPS6 I found one quick. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes. Finally I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally got my weapon from the ground the person was gone. This made me pretty made seens how I waited @CAPS3 long and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went looking for someone for my team. I was looking my patience and getting frustrated. ""@CAPS7 anyone even out here?"" I whispered ""@CAPS8! I got you @CAPS9!"" someone shouted from above. Then @PERSON1 jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he was watching me. He   was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot.

12249	19559	7	A patent person in my life is my mom. Aicason my mom is patient because she always drives me to soccer events. Soccer practice friends home and other places if I need to go there. Also she spends money on our soccer, our hobbies and other things we need or sometimes want. She is never certain and is always kind when were sad or anry and takes lot of time to do stuff for us. Also whenever were havinn trouble in school she helps us study, an example of most of these events would be that she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year and thats not including additional things like gear, uniforms and team stuff. An example of her driving us places is that she dedicates about an hour even has to driving me and my brother places like cross country, soccer and basketball she also helps us with our homework @CAPS1 because when I needed help with a test she stayed with me for corily @NUM1 hours. Also whenever I do bad in school she just encourages me to do better but still is a little discouraged because she wants me to do good. She also supports me being a vegetarian even though it means making two meals in conclusion my mom is one of the most patient people I know.	9	7		2				2.0	2.0	2.0	3.0			0.0	2.0	2.0	3.0									"Write about patience.

She was the president of a club named @CAPS1-@CAPS2 for about one or two years. But now that she is not the president anymore, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But with either position, she wasnt earning only money. So she decided that she would get a job. She started looking for jobs online and in the newspapers and things. She couldnt find a job that was right for her. She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job. She kept on looking and looking. She kept looking for about another year until, finally she found a job at @CAPS3.C.C. she now teaches a computer class for collage or older people. If she liked, she would have ended up with a job that didnt enjoy.	11	8		3				3.0	3.0	2.0	3.0			2.0	2.0	2.0	2.0									"Write about patience.

Our family was about a quarter of the way there when he gets into a major traffic jam. @CAPS3 on! @CAPS4 sister yelled. I just kept quiet.

Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty god! We did sell some stuff but, some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate.
